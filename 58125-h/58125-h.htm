<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The part performed by the militia and militia officers
in the War of the Revolution does not seem always
to have received the historical recognition which
it deserves. It was really of great importance, especially
in southern New England and the Middle
States, at times actually rivaling and often indispensably
supplementing that of the regular Continental
Army. It will not be invidious to say that of
all the militia none was of more importance or rendered
more valuable services than those regiments
which occupied the disputed border country between
the American and British lines, and which guarded
the bases of supplies and the routes of communication.
There was probably no region in which borderland
friction was more severe and intrigues more
sinister than that which lay between the British in
New York City and the Americans at the Highlands
of the Hudson, nor was there a highway of
travel and communication more important than that
which led from Hartford in Connecticut to Fishkill
and West Point in New York.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of the present volume to present
the salient features of the public career of a militia
colonel who was perhaps most of all concerned in
holding that troublous territory for the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
cause, in guarding that route of travel and supply,
and in serving the government of the State of New
York, to whose seat his territorial command was so
immediately adjacent. It is intended to be merely a
memoir of Henry Ludington, together with such a
historical setting as may seem desirable for a just
understanding of the circumstances of his life and its
varied activities. It makes no pretense of giving a
complete genealogy of the Ludington family in
America, either before or after his time, but confines
itself to his own direct descent and a few of his
immediate descendants. The facts of his life, never
before compiled, have been gleaned from many
sources, including Colonial, Revolutionary and
State records, newspaper files, histories and diaries,
correspondence, various miscellaneous manuscript
collections, and some oral traditions of whose authenticity
there is substantial evidence. The most copious
and important data have been secured from the
manuscript collections of two of Henry Ludington’s
descendants, Mr. Lewis S. Patrick, of Marinette,
Wisconsin, who has devoted much time and painstaking
labor to the work of searching for and securing
authentic information of his distinguished ancestor,
and Mr. Charles Henry Ludington, of New
York, who has received many valuable papers and
original documents and records from a descendant
of Sibyl Ludington Ogden, Henry Ludington’s
first-born child. It is much regretted that among
all these data, no portrait of Henry Ludington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
is in existence, and that therefore none can
be given in this book. In addition, the old
records of Charlestown and Malden, Massachusetts,
and of Branford, East Haven and New
Haven, Connecticut, the collections of the Connecticut
Historical Society, the early annals of New
York, especially in the French and Indian and the
Revolutionary wars, and the publications of the New
England Genealogical Society, have also been utilized,
together with the Papers of Governor George
Clinton, Lossing’s “Field Book of the Revolution,”
Blake’s and Pelletreau’s histories of Putnam County,
Smith’s “History of Dutchess County,” Bolton’s
“History of Westchester County,” and other works,
credit to which is given in the text of this volume. It
is hoped that this brief and simple setting forth of
the public services of Henry Ludington during the
formative period of our country’s history will prove
of sufficient interest to the members of his family and
to others to justify the printing of this memoir.</p>

<span class="smaller">GENEALOGICAL</span></h2>

<p>“This family of the Ludingtons,” says Gray in
his genealogical work on the nobility and
gentry of England, “were of a great estate, of whom
there was one took a large travail to the seeing of
many countries where Our Saviour wrought His
miracles, as is declared by his monument in the College
of Worcester, where he is interred.” The immediate
reference of the quaint old chronicler was to
the Ludingtons of Shrawley and Worcester, and the
one member of that family whom he singled out for
special mention was Robert Ludington, gentleman,
a merchant in the Levantine trade. In the pursuit of
business, and also probably for curiosity and pleasure,
he traveled extensively in Italy, Greece, Turkey,
Egypt and Syria, at a time when such journeyings
were more arduous and even perilous than those of
to-day in equatorial or polar wildernesses. In accord
with the pious custom of the age he also made a pilgrimage
to Palestine, and visited the chief places
made memorable in Holy Writ. He died at Worcester
at the age of 76 years, in 1625, a few years before
the first colonists of his name appeared in North
America. The exact degree of relationship between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
him and them is not now ascertainable, but it is supposable
that it was close, while there is no reason
whatever for doubting that the American Ludingtons
were members of that same family “of a great
estate,” whether or not they came from the particular
branch of it which was identified with Shrawley and
Worcester.</p>

<p>For the Ludington family in England antedated
Robert Ludington of Worcester by many generations,
and was established elsewhere in the Midlands
than in Worcestershire. Its chief seat seems to have
been in the Eastern Midlands, though its name has
long been implanted on all the shires from Lincoln
to Worcester, including Rutland, Leicester, Huntingdon,
Northampton, and Warwick. There is a
credible tradition that in the Third Crusade a Ludington
was among the followers of Richard Cœur de
Lion, and that afterward, when that adventurous
monarch was a prisoner in Austria, he sought to visit
him in the guise of a holy palmer, in order to devise
with him some plan for his escape. Because of these
loyal exploits, we are told, he was invested with a
patent of nobility, and with the coat of arms thereafter
borne by the Ludington family, to wit (according
to Burke’s Heraldry): Pale of six argent and
azure on a chief, gules a lion passant and gardant.
Crest, a palmer’s staff, erect. Motto, <i>Probum non
penitet</i>.</p>

<p>Authentic mention of other Ludingtons, honorable
and often distinguished, may be found from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
time to time in English history, especially in the annals
of Tudor and Stuart reigns. In the reign of
Henry VIII a Sir John Ludington was a man of
mark in the north of England, and his daughter,
Elizabeth Ludington, married first an alderman of
the City of London, and second, after his death, Sir
John Chamberlain. In the sixteenth century, the
Rev. Thomas Ludington, M.A., was a Fellow of
Christ Church College, Oxford, where his will, dated
May 28, 1593, is still preserved. In the next century
another clergyman, the Rev. Stephen Ludington,
D.D., was married about 1610 to Anne, daughter of
Richard Streetfield, at Chiddington, Kent. Afterward
he was made prebendary of Langford, Lincoln,
on November 15, 1641, and in June, 1674, resigned
that place to his son, the Rev. Stephen Ludington,
M.A. He was also rector of Carlton Scrope,
and archdeacon of Stow, filling the last-named place
at the time of his death in 1677. His grave is to be
seen in Lincoln Cathedral. His son, mentioned
above, was married to Ann Dillingham in Westminster
Abbey in 1675.</p>

<p>It will be hereafter observed in this narrative that
the family name of Ludington has been variously
spelled in this country, as Ludington, Luddington,
Ludinton, Ludenton, etc. Some of these variations
have appeared also in England, together with the
form Lydington, which has not been used here.
These same forms have also been applied to the several
towns and parishes which bear or have borne the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
family name, and especially that one parish which is
so ancient and which was formerly so closely identified
with the Ludingtons that question has risen
whether the parish was named for the family or the
family derived its name from the parish. This place,
at one time called Lydington, was first mentioned in
the Domesday Book of William the Conqueror,
where it was called Ludington—whence we may
properly regard that as the original and correct form
of the name. It was then a part of the Bishopric of
Lincoln and of the county of Northampton; Rutlandshire,
in which the place now is, not having been
set off from Northampton until the time of King
John. The Bishop of Lincoln had a residential
palace there, which was afterward transformed into
a charity hospital, and as such is still in existence. In
the chapel of the hospital is an ancient folio Bible
bearing the inscription “Ludington Hospital Bible,”
and containing in manuscript a special prayer for
the hospital, which is regularly read as a part of the
service. The name of Loddington is borne by parishes
in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, that
of Luddington by parishes in Lincolnshire and Warwickshire
(the latter near Stratford-on-Avon and intimately
associated with Shakespeare), and that of
Luddington-in-the-Brook by one which is partly in
Northamptonshire and partly in Huntingdonshire;
all testifying to the early extent of the Ludington
family throughout the Midland counties of England.</p>

<p>The earliest record of a Ludington in America occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in 1635. On April 6 of that year the ship <i>Hopewell</i>,
which had already made several voyages to these
shores, sailed from London for Massachusetts Bay,
under the command of William Bundock. Her Company
of eleven passengers was notable for the youthfulness
of all its members, the youngest being twelve
and the oldest only twenty-two years of age. Seven
of them were young men, or boys, and four were
girls. One of the latter, whose age was given as
eighteen years, was registered on the ship’s list as
“Christiom” Ludington, but other records, in London,
show that the name, although very distinctly
written in that form, should have been “Christian.”
Concerning her origin and her subsequent fate, all
records are silent. In John Farmer’s “List of Ancient
Names in Boston and Vicinity, 1630-1644,”
however, appears the name of “Ch. Luddington”;
presumably that of this same young woman. Again,
in the Old Granary burying ground in Boston, on
Tomb No. 108, there appear the names of Joseph
Tilden and C. Ludington; and a plausible conjecture
is that Christian Ludington became the wife of
Joseph Tilden and that thus they were both buried in
the same grave. But this is conjecture and nothing
more. So far as ascertained facts are concerned,
Christian Ludington makes both her first and her
last recorded appearance in that passenger list of the
<i>Hopewell</i>.</p>

<p>The next appearance of the name in American
annals, however,—passing by the mere undated mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of one Christopher Ludington in connection
with the Virginia colony,—places us upon assured
ground and marks the foundation of the family in
America. William Ludington was born in England—place
not known—in 1608, and his wife Ellen—her
family name not known—was also born there in
1617. They were married in 1636, and a few years
later came to America and settled in the Massachusetts
Bay colony, in that part of Charlestown which
was afterward set off into the separate town of Malden.
The date of their migration hither is not precisely
known. Savage’s “Genealogical Register”
mentions William Ludington as living in Charlestown
in 1642; which is quite correct, though, as Mr.
Patrick aptly points out, the date is by no means conclusive
as to the time of his first settlement in that
place. Indeed, it is certain that he had settled in
Charlestown some time before, for in the early records
of the colony, under date of May 13, 1640, appears
the repeal of a former order forbidding the
erection of houses at a distance of more than half a
mile from the meeting house, and with the repeal is
an order remitting to William Ludington the penalty
for having disobeyed the original decree. That
restriction of building was, of course, a prudent and
probably a necessary one, in the early days of the
colony, for keeping the town compact and thus affording
to all its inhabitants greater security against
Indian attacks. It seems to have been disregarded,
however, by the actual building of some houses outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the prescribed line, and in such violation a
heavy penalty was incurred. By 1640 the law became
obsolete. Boston had then been founded ten
years. The colonies of New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut had been settled and organized.
And three years before the Pequods had been
vanquished. It was therefore fitting to rescind the
order, and to let the borders of Charlestown be enlarged.
We may assume that it was with a realization
that this would speedily be done that William
Ludington, either at the very beginning of 1640
or previous to that year, built his house on the forbidden
ground, and thus incurred the penalty, which,
however, was not imposed upon him; and we may
further assume that it was this act of his which finally
called official attention to the obsolete character of
the law and thus brought about its repeal. In the
light thus thrown upon him, William Ludington appears
as probably a man of considerable standing in
the community, and of high general esteem, else his
disregard of the law would scarcely have been thus
condoned.</p>

<p>Reckoning, then, that William Ludington was
settled in his house in the outskirts of Charlestown—on
the north side of the Mystic River, in what was
later called Malden—before May 13, 1640, the date
of his arrival in America must probably be placed as
early as 1639, if not even earlier. He remained at
Charlestown for a little more than twenty years, and
was a considerable landowner and an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
member of the community. Many references to him
appear in the old colonial records, with some apparent
conflicts of date, which are doubtless due to the
transition stage through which the calendar was then
passing. Most of the civilized world adopted the
present Gregorian calendar in the sixteenth century,
but it was not until 1751 that Great Britain and the
British colonies did so. Consequently during most of
our colonial history, including the times of William
Ludington, the year began on March 25 instead of
January 1, and all dates in the three months of January,
February and March (down to the 24th) were
credited to a different year from that to which we
should now credit them. In many cases historians
have endeavored to indicate such dates with accuracy
by giving the numbers of both years, thus: March 1,
1660-61. But in many cases this has not been done
and only a single year number is given, thus causing
much uncertainty and doubt as to which year is
meant. There were also other disturbances of chronology,
and other differences in the statement of
dates, involving other months of the year; especially
that of two months’ difference at what is now the end
of the year. Thus the birth of William Ludington’s
daughter Mary is variously stated to have occurred
on December 6, 1642, December 6, 1642-43, February
6, 1643, and February 6, 1642-43. Also the
birth and death of his son Matthew are credited,
respectively, to October 16, 1657, and November 12,
1657, and to December 16, 1657, and January 12,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
1658. There is record of the purchase, on October
10, 1649, of a tract of twenty acres of land at Malden,
by William Ludington, described in the deed as
a weaver, from Ralph Hall, a pipe-stave maker, and
also of the sale of five acres by William Ludington to
Joseph Carter, a currier. The deed given by Ralph
Hall is entitled “A Sale of Land by Ralph Hall
unto William Luddington, both of Charlestowne,
the 10th day of the 10th moneth, 1649,” and runs as
follows:</p>

<p>This is testified before the worshipfull Mr.

</div>

<p>On November 30, 1651, William Ludington was
mentioned in the will of Henry Sandyes, of Charlestown,
as one of the creditors of his estate, and in 1660
he was enrolled as a juror in Malden. Early in the
latter year, however, he removed from Malden or
Charlestown to the New Haven, Connecticut, colony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and there settled at East Haven, adjoining
Branford, on the east side of the Quinnipiac River.
Five years before there had been established at that
place the first iron works in Connecticut. The raw
material used was the rich bog ore which was then
found in large quantities in the swamps of North
Haven and elsewhere, precisely like that which at a
still later date was abundantly found and worked in
the swamps of southern New Jersey, where the name
of “Furnace” is still borne by more than one village
on the site of a long-abandoned foundry. This industry
flourished at East Haven until about 1680,
when the supply of bog ore was exhausted and the
works were closed. Although William Ludington
had been a weaver at Malden, he appears to have
been interested in these iron works, and indeed probably
removed to East Haven for the sake of connecting
and identifying himself with them. But his
career there was short. On March 27, 1660, evidently
soon after his arrival there, he was complainant in a
slander suit, and in either the same year or the next
year he died, at the East Haven iron works. The
manner of his death, whether from sickness or from
accident, is unknown. But it evidently produced
some impression in the community, since it is the only
death specially recorded in the early annals of the
place.</p>

<p>The precise date of his death, even the year in
which it occurred, is a matter of uncertainty. Mr.
Patrick quotes a passage from the East Haven records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which says: “In 1662 John Porter obtained a
piece of land to set his blacksmith shop upon …
and about the same time William Ludington died.”
Therefore he concludes that William Ludington
died in 1662. But was it 1662 according to the chronology
of those times or according to that of our
time? Wyman’s records of Charlestown and Malden,
which mention William Ludington’s departure
thence for East Haven, relate that on October 1,
1661, John White made petition for the appointment
of an administrator of William Ludington’s estate
in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and Pope’s
“Pioneers of Massachusetts” confirms that record,
giving the name of the petitioner as Wayte or Waite,
and adding that the inventory of the estate was filed
by James Barrat, or Barret, on April 1, 1662. Mr.
Patrick has the name Bariat and the date February
1, 1662. Here we have, then, the same discrepancy
of exactly two months in statement of date which was
noticed in the case of Matthew Ludington’s birth
and death. Of course, if the petition for administration
of William Ludington’s estate was made on
October 1, 1661, his death must have occurred before
that date, instead of in 1662 as the East Haven records
suggest. The explanation of the apparent
conflict of dates is doubtless to be found in the
changes of calendar to which reference has been
made, one historian giving the date according to the
chronology then prevailing and another according to
that of the present day. Concerning the date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
probating of his estate at East Haven, however, there
is apparently no doubt, since in the records of it the
dual year-dates are given. That estate was inventoried
and appraised by John Cooper and Matthew
Moulthrop, and their inventory, according to Hoadly’s
“New Haven Colonial Records,” was filed in
court at New Haven on March 3, 1662, according to
the chronology of that time, or 1663 according to
ours. This interesting document was entitled “An
Inventory of ye Estate of William Ludington, late
of New Haven, deceased, amounting to £183 and
10s., upon Oath attested yt ye Aprizents was just
to the best of their light, by John Cooper, Sen.,
and Matthew Moulthrop in Court at New Haven,
1662-63.” It ran in detail as follows:</p>

<p>Again, in the “Records of the Proprietors of New
Haven” we find that “At a Court held at New
Haven March 3, 1662-3 … an inventory of the
Estate of Willm. Luddington deceased whas presented.…
The widdow upon oath attested to the
fulness of it to the best of her knowledge.… The
widdow being asked if her husband made noe will
answered that she knew of none for she was not at
home when he died.… The matter respecting the
childrens portions was deferred till next court &amp; the
… widdow with him that shee was to marry &amp; all
her children above fourteen years of age was ordered
then to appear.…” At this date, therefore, William
Ludington’s widow was engaged to be married
again, and that engagement was publicly announced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Moreover, she was actually married to her second
husband, John Rose, a few weeks later, for on May 5
following, in 1662-63, according to the “Proprietors’
Records,” the court was again in session, and “John
Rose who married widdow Ludington was called to
know what security he would give for the childrens
portions that was not yet of age to receive them.” It
is true that in those days the period of mourning before
remarriage was sometimes abbreviated, but it is
scarcely conceivable that this widow’s marriage took
place within a few months of her husband’s death, or
sooner than a year thereafter. It may therefore be
assumed that William Ludington’s death, at the
East Haven iron works, occurred at least as early as
March or April, 1661-62.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that William Ludington
was not only a man of note in the East Haven community
but that also he was a man of considerable
property—more than would be suggested by the item
of “house and land 60 lbs.” in the inventory. For
the New Haven Land Records show that in 1723 his
son, William Ludington, 2nd, sold to Thomas Robinson
“part of that tract of land set out to my father,
William Luddington, which tract contains 100
acres.” This property was in East Haven, just
across the river from Branford.</p>

<p>The children of William and Ellen Ludington
were seven in number. The first was Thomas, who
was born (probably in England) in 1637. He removed
to Newark, New Jersey, in 1666, and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a farmer—since when in 1689 he sold some land with
a house and barn at New Haven he described himself
in the deed as a husbandman. He was an assessor
and a surveyor of highways at Newark, and left children
whose descendants are now to be found in the
northern part of New Jersey. His oldest child,
John, remained at New Haven, married, and had
issue, his first-born, James, being a soldier in the
French and Indian war and being killed in battle on
September 8, 1756. The second child of William and
Ellen Ludington was John Ludington, who was
born (probably at Charlestown, Massachusetts) in
1640. He was living at East Haven in 1664, and
afterward, Mr. Patrick thinks, removed to Vermont.
The third child was Mary, of whose birth various
dates are given, as already noted. The fourth was
Henry Ludington, the date of whose birth is not
known, but who was killed in the war with King
Philip, at the end of 1675 or beginning of 1676, as
appears in the “New Haven Probate Records,”
where is found an inventory of the estate of “Henry
Luddington late of N. haven slayne in the warre
taken &amp; apprised by Mathew Moulthrop &amp; John
Potter Janry. 3, 1676.” The fifth child was Hannah,
the dates of whose birth and death are unknown.
The sixth child was William Ludington, 2nd, who
was born about 1655 and died in February, 1737.
His first wife was Martha Rose, daughter of his stepfather,
John Rose, and his second was Mercy Whitehead.
According to Dodd’s “East Haven Register”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
he was a man of means, of intelligence, of ability, and
of important standing in the community. He had
two sons and one daughter by his first wife, and two
sons and six daughters by his second. His first-born,
the son of Martha Rose, was Henry Ludington, who
was born in 1679, was a carpenter, married Sarah,
daughter of William Collins, on August 20, 1700,
had eight sons and four daughters, and died in the
summer of 1727—of whom, or of his descendants, we
shall presently hear much more. Finally, the seventh
child of William and Ellen Ludington was
Matthew, who as already related was born at Malden
and died in infancy. Despite the removal of Thomas
Ludington to Newark, and that of John Ludington
(probably) to Vermont, they appear to have retained
much interest in the New Haven colony, since
in the “Colony Record of Deeds” of Connecticut we
find Thomas, John, and William Ludington enumerated
among the proprietors of New Haven in
1685, who were, presumably, the above mentioned
first, second, and sixth children of William and
Ellen Ludington.</p>

<p>Recurring for a moment to the family of William
Ludington, 2nd, and passing by for the time his
first-born, Henry Ludington, it is to be observed
that his second child, Eleanor, married Nathaniel
Bailey, of Guilford, Connecticut, and had issue; his
third, William Ludington, 3rd, married Anna
Hodge, lived at Waterbury and Plymouth, Connecticut,
and had issue, his sixth son, Samuel, serving in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the French and Indian war, and his grandson, Timothy,
son of William 3rd’s first-born, Matthew, also
serving in that war and being killed in battle at East
Haven in the War of the Revolution; the fourth,
Mercy, married Ebenezer Deanes or Dains, of Norwich,
Connecticut, and had issue; the fifth, Mary,
married John Dawson, of East Haven, and had
issue; the sixth, Hannah, married Isaac Penfield, of
New Haven, and had issue; the seventh, John, married
Elizabeth Potter, and had issue, his son Jude
serving in the French and Indian war; the eighth,
Eliphalet, married Abigail Collins, and had issue, his
third son, Amos, serving in the French and Indian
war; the ninth, Elizabeth, died in childhood; the
tenth, Dorothy, married Benjamin Mallory and had
issue; and the eleventh, Dorcas, married James Way
and had issue.</p>

<p>Returning now to Henry Ludington, eldest son of
William Ludington, 2nd, who was the sixth child of
the original William Ludington, it is to be observed
that his first child, Daniel, married first Hannah
Payne, and second Susannah Clark, and had issue,
his second child, Ezra, serving in the French and Indian
war, and his ninth, Collins, in the War of the
Revolution; his second, William Ludington, married
first Mary Knowles, of Branford, and second
Mary Wilkinson, of Branford, and had issue—of
whom we shall hereafter hear much more; his third,
Sarah, died in childhood; his fourth, Dinah, married
Isaac Thorpe; his fifth, Lydia, married Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Thorpe; his sixth, Nathaniel, married first Mary
Chidsey, and second Eunice (Russell) Smith, and
had issue; his seventh, Moses, married Eunice Chidsey;
his eighth, Aaron, died at sea; his ninth, Elisha,
died in infancy; his tenth, also named Elisha, settled
in Phillipse Precinct, Dutchess County, New York,
married, and had a daughter, Abigail, of whom more
hereafter; his eleventh, Sarah, probably died unmarried,
though Dodd’s “East Haven Register” says
she married Daniel Mead; and his twelfth, Thomas,
was drowned, unmarried.</p>

<p>Turning back, once more, to the William Ludington
last mentioned, who was the second son of Henry
Ludington, we find that he was born at Branford,
Connecticut, on September 6, 1702. He married
Mary Knowles, of Branford, on November 5, 1730.
She died on April 16, 1759, and on April 17, 1760,—just
a day after the year of mourning had elapsed!—he
married for his second wife Mary Wilkinson, also
of Branford. His eight children, all of his first wife,
were as follows: First, Submit, who married Stephen
Johnson, of Branford; second, Mary; third, Henry,
of whom we shall hear more, since he forms the chief
subject of this book; fourth, Lydia, who married
William (or, according to Dodd, Aaron) Buckley, of
Branford; fifth, Samuel; sixth, Rebecca; seventh,
Anne; and eighth, Stephen. On the night of Monday,
May 20, 1754, part of William Ludington’s
house at Branford was destroyed by fire, and his
sixth and seventh children, Rebecca and Anne, aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seven and four years, respectively, perished in the
flames.</p>

<p>Attention is thus finally centered upon the second
Henry Ludington, who was the third child of William
Ludington, who was the second child of the first
Henry Ludington, who was the first child of the second
William Ludington, who was the sixth child of
the first William Ludington, who was the founder of
the Ludington family in America. The sources of
information concerning him and his career, which
have been mentioned in the preface to this volume,
are varied and numerous rather than copious or comprehensive;
but they are sufficient to indicate that he
was a man of more than ordinary force of character
and of more than average importance and influence
in his time and place, and that he is entitled to remembrance
and to enrolment among those who contributed
materially, and with no little sacrifice of self,
to the making of the State of New York and of the
United States of America.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">BEFORE THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

<p>Henry Ludington, the third child of
William and Mary (Knowles) Ludington,
was born at Branford, Connecticut, on May 25,
1739. Some records give the date as 1738, but the
weight of authority indicates the later year. Branford,
originally called Totoket, was a part of the
second purchase at New Haven in 1638, but was not
successfully settled until two years later, when a dissatisfied
company from Wethersfield, headed by
William Swayne, secured a grant of it. Together
with Milford, Guilford, Stamford, Southold (Long
Island), and New Haven, it made up the separate
jurisdiction of New Haven, under an ecclesiastical
government, until 1665, when all were merged into
the greater Colony of Connecticut, Branford being
erected into an organized town with representation
in the General Court, in 1651. The place won lasting
distinction in 1700, when it was the scene of the
practical founding of Yale College; ten ministers,
who had been named as trustees of “The School of
the Church,” each laying upon the table in their
meeting-room a number of books, with the words, “I
give these books for the founding of a college in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
colony.” The next year the college was chartered
and was formally opened at Saybrook, and in 1716-17
it was permanently removed to New Haven. At
the time of Henry Ludington’s birth, therefore, New
Haven had become fully established as the metropolis
of that part of the colony, and Branford, which had
at first been its peer and rival, had become reconciled
to the status of a suburban town. The educational
facilities of Branford were similar to those of other
colonial towns; to wit, primitive in character and
chiefly under church control. To what extent young
Ludington availed himself of them does not appear,
but so far as may be judged from his letters and
other papers in after years he was an indifferent
scholar, probably thinking more of action than of
study.</p>

<p>Such as his schooling was, however, it was ended
at an early date and the school-boy became a man of
action when only half-way through his teens. The
epoch-making struggle commonly known as the
French and Indian War, which was really a part of
the Seven Years’ War in Europe, and which secured
for the English absolute dominance in North America
and transformed the maps of two continents, began
when he was fifteen years old, and made a strong
appeal to his adventurous and daring disposition;
and at an early date, probably in 1755, though the
meager records now in existence are not conclusive
on that point, he enlisted in those Colonial levies
which formed so invaluable an adjunct to the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
British Army in all the campaigns of that war. No
complete roster of the Connecticut troops is now in
existence, but the “East Haven Register” tells us
that many men from East Haven and Branford were
enlisted for service with the British Army near the
Great Lakes, of whom the greater part were lost
through sickness and in battle. In these levies were
several members of the Ludington family, beside
Henry Ludington. Our genealogical review has already
indicated the service in that war of James,
Ezra, Timothy, Samuel, Jude, and Amos Ludington,
uncles and cousins of Henry Ludington. As
some of the Ludingtons had, years before the war,
removed from Connecticut to Dutchess County, New
York, some members of the family were also among
the troops from the latter region. Old records tell
that in Captain Richard Rea’s Dutchess County
regiment were two young farmers, Comfort Loudinton
and Asa Loudinton—obviously meaning Ludington—respectively
19 and 17 years old; the former
with brown eyes and dark complexion, the latter with
brown eyes and fresh complexion.</p>

<p>Henry Ludington enlisted in Captain Foote’s
company of the Second Connecticut Regiment, a
notable body of troops which was put forward to
bear much of the brunt of the campaign. The regiment
was at first commanded by Colonel Elizur
Goodrich, and later by Colonel Nathan Whiting, one
of the most distinguished Colonial officers of that
war. The regiment was assigned to duty under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Major-General (afterward Sir) William Johnson,
who, with a Colonial army and numerous Indian
allies under the famous Mohawk chieftain Hendrick,
was moving to meet the French at Lake George.
The march from New Haven was made by way of
Amenia and Dover, in Dutchess County, New York,
to the Hudson River, and thence northward to the
“dark and bloody ground” of the North Woods.
Young Ludington was of a lively and venturesome
disposition and, as family traditions show, had a propensity
to practical joking which more than once put
him in peril of not undeserved punishment, which,
however, he managed to avoid.</p>

<p>It was early in September, 1755, when he was in
only his seventeenth year, that the young soldier received
his “baptism of fire” in the desperate battle of
Lake George, near the little sheet of water afterward
known as Bloody Pond because of the hue its water
took from the gory drainage of the battlefield. General
Johnson, with his Colonial troops and Indian
allies, was moving northward. Baron Dieskau, with
a French and Indian army, moving southward, embarked
at Fort Frederick, Crown Point, came down
the lake in a fleet of small boats, and landed at
Skenesborough, now Whitehall. On the night of
Sunday, September 7, word came to Johnson that
the enemy was marching down from Fort Edward to
Lake George, and early the next morning plans were
made to meet them. It was at first suggested that
only a few hundred men be sent forward to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
enemy in check until the main army could dispose
and fortify itself, but Hendrick, the shrewd Mohawk
warrior, objected to sending so small a force. “If
they are to fight,” he said, “they are too few; if they
are to be killed, they are too many.” Accordingly
the number was increased to 1,200, comprising and,
indeed, led by the Connecticut troops. Colonel
Ephraim Williams, a brave and skilful officer, was in
command, with Colonel Nathan Whiting, of New
Haven, as his chief lieutenant. They came upon the
enemy at Rocky Brook, about four miles from Lake
George, and found the French and Indians arrayed
in the form of a crescent, the horns of which extended
for some distance on both sides of the road which
there led through a dense forest. The devoted Colonial
detachment marched straight at the center of
the crescent, and was quickly attacked in front and
on both flanks at the same time. Williams and Hendrick
were among the first to fall, and their followers
were cut down in great numbers. Thereupon Colonel
Whiting succeeded to the general command, and
perceiving that the Colonials were outnumbered and
outflanked, ordered a retreat, which was skilfully
conducted, with little further loss. When the army
was thus reunited, hasty preparations were made to
meet the onslaught of the foe, and at noon the conflict
began in deadly earnest. The forces were commanded,
respectively, by Johnson and Dieskau in
person, until the former was disabled by a wound,
when his place was taken by General Lyman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fulfilled his duties with singular ability and success.
After four hours of fighting on the defensive, the
English and Colonials leaped over their breastworks
and charged the foe with irresistible fury. The
French and Indians were routed with great slaughter,
and Baron Dieskau himself, badly wounded, was
taken prisoner.</p>

<p class="caption">(From sketch made by Miss Alice Ludington, great-great-granddaughter
of Henry Ludington.)</p>
</div>

<p>Henry Ludington was in the thickest of both parts
of this battle, having been in the detachment which
was sent forward in advance. He came off unscathed,
but he had the heartrending experience of
seeing both his uncle and his cousin shot dead at his
side. These were probably his uncle Amos Ludington
(called Asa in the “East Haven Register,” as already
noted), son of Eliphalet Ludington, and his
cousin Ezra, son of Daniel Ludington. The uncle
fell first, pierced by a French bullet. The cousin
sprang to his side and stooped to lift him, and in the
act was himself shot, and a few moments later both
died. Soon after this battle the term of enlistment
of the Connecticut militia expired, but reënlistments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were general. According to the French and
Indian War Rolls, and the Connecticut Historical
Collections as searched by Mr. Patrick, Henry Ludington
again enlisted on April 19, 1756, served under
Colonel Andrew Ward at Crown Point, and was discharged
at the expiration of his term on November
13, 1756. Again, he was in Lieutenant Maltbie’s
company, under Colonel Newton, at the time of the
“general alarm” for the relief of Fort William Henry,
in August, 1757, on which occasion his time of
service was only fifteen days. Finally, he was in the
campaign of 1759, in the Second Connecticut Regiment,
under Colonel Nathan Whiting, being a member
of David Baldwin’s Third Company. In this
year he enlisted on April 14, and was duly discharged
on December 21, 1759. During this memorable
period of service the young soldier marched with the
British and American troops to Canada, and participated
in the crowning triumph at Quebec, on September
13, 1759, and a little later was intrusted with
the charge of a company of sixty wounded or invalid
soldiers, who were to return to New England. The
march was made across country, from Quebec to Boston,
in the dead of the very severe winter of 1759-60,
and the labors and perils of the journey were sufficient
to tax to the utmost the skill and resourcefulness
of the youth of only twenty years. For many nights
their camp consisted of caves or burrows in the snowdrifts,
where they slept on beds of spruce boughs,
wrapped in their blankets. Provisions failed, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and some meals were made of the bark and twigs of
birch trees and the berries of the juniper. Through
all these hardships young Ludington led his comrades
safely to their destination. Then, in the spring
of 1760, he proceeded from Boston to Branford, and
thus terminated for the time his active military
career. In recognition of his services he received
from King George II the commission of a lieutenant
in the British Colonial Army, which he held until, in
the succeeding reign, news came of the enactment of
the Stamp Act, when he resigned it. Later, on February
13, 1773, he accepted a captain’s commission
from William Tryon, the last British governor of
New York, which he held until the beginning of the
Revolution. This commission was in the regiment
commanded by Beverly Robinson, that eminent British
Loyalist who was the intermediary between Sir
Henry Clinton and Benedict Arnold. It was at
Robinson’s country mansion that much of Arnold’s
plotting was done, and it was there, while at dinner,
that the traitor received the news of the failure of his
treason through the capture of his agent, Major
André.</p>

</div>

<p>One other incident of Henry Ludington’s service
demands passing attention. In one of the returns of
his regiment, in connection with the fifteen days’ service
in August, 1757, he is recorded as “Deserted.”
Generally speaking, no worse blot than that can well
be put upon a soldier’s record. But it is quite obvious
that in this case it is devoid of its usual serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
significance. It is certain that he did not actually
desert in the ordinary present meaning of that term.
This we know, because there is no record nor intimation
of any steps ever being taken to punish him for
what would have been regarded as a heinous crime;
because soon after that entry against him he was
serving with credit in the army and continued so to
do; because thereafter he was intrusted with the important
march to Boston which has been described;
and because, after having honorably completed his
service in the army, he received a royal commission as
an officer. In those early days, when an army was
campaigning in an almost trackless wilderness and
warfare was largely of the most irregular description,
it was not difficult for a soldier to become detached
and practically lost from the rest of his army, and
perhaps not be able to rejoin it for some time. Such
a mishap might the more easily have befallen an impetuous
and adventurous youth such as Henry Ludington
was. And of course the record “Deserted”
might naturally enough have been put against his
name when he failed to respond to roll-call and no
explanation of his absence was forthcoming.</p>

<p>In the French and Indian War the Colonial troops
were paid for their services by the various Colonial
governments, which latter were afterward reimbursed
for such expenditures by the British Government.
It was, however, with a view to compelling
the Colonies to bear the cost of the war, by levying
taxes upon them at the will of Parliament, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
British Government entered upon the fatal policy
which a few years later cost it the major part of its
American possessions. Because of that change of
government, no pension system was ever created for
the veterans of that war. In 1815, however, near the
close of Henry Ludington’s life, such pensions were
proposed, and with a view to establishing his eligibility
to receive one, in the absence of the authoritative
records of the Connecticut troops, he secured from
two of his former comrades in arms the following
affidavits—here reproduced <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:</p>

<p>Both of the foregoing affidavits or depositions are
taken from copies of the originals, made by Lewis
Ludington, son of Henry Ludington, on September
19, 1815, and now in possession of Lewis Ludington’s
son.</p>

<p>We have seen that Henry Ludington, at the age
of twenty-one, escorted a company of invalided soldiers
from Quebec to Boston in the winter of 1759-60,
and thereafter returned to civil life. One of his
first acts was to get married, his bride being his
cousin, Abigail Ludington, daughter of his father’s
younger brother, Elisha Ludington. As already
noted, Elisha Ludington upon his marriage had removed
from Connecticut to Dutchess County, New
York, and had settled in what was known as the
Phillipse Patent. The exact date of that migration
is not recorded, but it was probably some years before
the French and Indian war. As the Connecticut
troops on their way to that war marched across
Dutchess County, through Dover and Amenia, it is
to be presumed that Henry Ludington on that momentous
journey called at his uncle’s home, and saw
his cousin, afterward to be his wife, who had been
born on May 8, 1745, and was at that time consequently
a child of about ten years. Whether they
met again until his return from Quebec is not surely
known, but we may easily imagine the boy soldier’s
carrying with him into the northern wilderness an
affectionate memory of his little cousin, perhaps the
last of his kin to bid him good-by, and also her cherishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a romantic regard for the lad whom she had
seen march away with his comrades. At any rate,
their marriage followed close upon his return, taking
place on May 1, 1760, when he was not yet quite
twenty-one and she just under fifteen. Soon afterward
the young couple, apparently accompanied by
the rest of Henry Ludington’s immediate family, removed
to Dutchess County, New York, to be thereafter
identified with that historic region.</p>

<p>Dutchess County was one of the twelve counties
into which the Province of New York was divided
on November 1, 1683, the others being Albany,
Cornwall (now a part of the State of Maine),
Duke’s (now a part of Massachusetts), King’s, New
York, Orange, Queen’s, Richmond, Suffolk, Ulster,
and Westchester. Dutchess then comprised what is
now Putnam County, which was set off as a separate
county in 1812 and was named for General Israel
Putnam, who was in command of the forces there
during much of the Revolutionary War. In 1719
Dutchess County was divided into three wards,
known as Northern, Middle, and Southern, each extending
from the Hudson River to the Connecticut
line. Again, in 1737, these wards were subdivided
into seven precincts, called Beekman, Charlotte,
Crom Elbow, North, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, and
Southeast; and at later dates other precincts, or
towns, were formed, to wit: North East in 1746;
Amenia in 1762; Pawlings in 1768; and Frederickstown
in 1772. Fishkill and Rombout were also constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in colonial times. Frederickstown, where
the Ludingtons settled and with which we have most
to do, was a part of the Phillipse Patent, in the
Southern Ward of Dutchess County, now Putnam
County. It derived its name from Frederick Phillipse,
a kinsman of Adolphe Phillipse, the patentee
of Phillipse Manor or Patent. It has now been divided
and renamed, its old boundaries comprising
the present towns of Kent, Carmel, and Patterson,
and a part of Southeast, the present village of Patterson
occupying the site of the former Fredericksburgh.
The name of Kent was taken from the family
of that name, of which James Kent, the illustrious
jurist and chancellor of the State of New York, was
a member. It may be of interest to recall at this
point, also, that a certain strip of land at the eastern
side of Dutchess County was in dispute between
New York and Connecticut. This was known as
The Oblong, or the Oblong Patent, from its configuration,
and comprised 61,440 acres, in a strip about
two miles wide, now forming parts of Dutchess, Putnam,
and Westchester counties and including part
of the Westchester town of Bedford, and also Quaker
Hill, near Pawling, in Dutchess County, which was
once suggested as the capital of the State, and which
gets its name from having been first settled by Quakers.
The dispute over the New York-Connecticut
boundary and the consequent ownership of this land
arose before 1650, when the Dutch were still owners
of New York, or New Netherlands as the latter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
then called, and it was continued between the two
Colonies when they were both under British rule.
The settlement was effected by confirming New
York in possession of The Oblong, and granting to
Connecticut in return a tract of land on Long Island
Sound, eight miles by twelve in extent, which was
long called the “Equivalent Land,” and which is now
occupied by Greenwich, Stamford, and other towns.
The final demarcation of the boundary was not, however,
effected until as late as 1880.</p>

</div>

<p>The precise date of Henry Ludington’s settlement
in Dutchess County is not now known. Neither his
nor his father’s name appears in the 1762 survey of
Lot No. 6 of the Phillipse Patent, and it has been assumed
that therefore his arrival there must have been
at a later date than that. This reasoning must, however,
be challenged on the ground that—as we shall
presently see—on March 12, 1763, he was officially
recorded as a sub-sheriff of Dutchess County. It is
scarcely likely that he would have been appointed to
that office immediately upon his arrival in the county,
and we must therefore conclude that he settled there
at least early in 1762, if not before that year. He
made his home on a tract of 229 acres of land in
Frederickstown, at the north end of Lot No. 6 of the
Phillipse Patent, on the site of what was afterward
appropriately, though with awkward etymology,
called Ludingtonville. This land he was not able to
purchase outright, but leased for many years from
owners who clung to the old feudal notions of tenure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but at last, on July 15, 1812, he effected actual purchase
and received title deeds from Samuel Gouverneur
and his wife. On that property he built the first
grist- and saw-mills in that region, there being no
others nearer than the “Red Mills” at Lake Mahopac
and those built by John Jay on the Cross River, in
the town of Bedford, Westchester County—which
latter, by the way, remained in continuous operation,
with much of the original framework and sheathing,
until 1906, when they were destroyed to make room
for one of the Croton reservoirs. Ludington’s mills
were of course operated by water power, generated
by a huge “overshot” wheel, supplied with water conveyed
from a neighboring stream in a channel or
mill-race made of timber.</p>

<p>Near-by stood the house, which was several times
enlarged. The main building was two stories in
height, with an attic above. Through the center ran
a broad hall, with a stairway broken with a landing
and turn. At one side was a parlor and at the other a
sitting or living room, and back of each of these was
a bedroom. The parlor was wainscoted and ceiled
with planks of the fragrant and beautiful red cedar.
Beyond the sitting room, at the side of this main
building, was the “weaving room,” an apartment unknown
to our modern domestic economy, but essential
in colonial days. It was a large room, fitted with
a hand-loom, and a number of spinning wheels,
reels, swifts, and the other paraphernalia for the
manufacture of homespun fabrics of different kinds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
This room also contained a huge stone fireplace.
Beyond it, at the extreme east of the house, was the
kitchen, with its great fireplace and brick or stone
oven. The house fronted toward the south, and commanded
a fine outlook over one of the picturesque
landscapes for which that region is famed. Years
ago the original house was demolished, and a new
one was built on the same site by a grandson, George
Ludington. The location was a somewhat isolated
one, neighbors being few and not near, and the nearest
village, Fredericksburgh, on the present site of
Patterson, being some miles distant. The location
was, however, important, being on the principal route
from Northern Connecticut to the lower Hudson
Valley, the road leading from Hartford and New
Milford, Connecticut, through Fredericksburgh, past
Colonel Ludington’s, to Fishkill and West Point—a
circumstance which was of much interest and importance
to Colonel Ludington in the Revolution, as
we shall see. The population of the county at that
time was small and scattered. In 1746, or about the
time when Elisha Ludington went thither and Abigail
Ludington was born, the census showed a population
of 8,806, including 500 negro slaves. By 1749
the numbers had actually diminished to 7,912, of
whom only 421 were negroes. In 1756, however,
there were 14,148 inhabitants, including 859 negroes,
and Dutchess was the most populous county in the
colony, excepting Albany, which had 17,424 inhabitants.
The county was at that time able to contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to the army about 2,500 men. It had enjoyed exemption
from the Indian wars which had ravaged
other parts of the colony, and its situation and natural
resources gave it the advantages of varied industries.
It had the Hudson River at one side for
commerce, it was well watered and wooded, its open
fields were exceptionally fertile, it had abundant
water-power for mills, and it had—though this was
not realized until after the colonial period—much
mineral wealth.</p>

<p>Such was the community in which Henry Ludington
established himself at the beginning of his manhood
and married life, and in which he quickly rose to
prominence. The extent of his holdings of land, and
the fact of his proprietorship of important mills,
made him a leading factor in business affairs, while
his bent for public business soon led him into both
the civil and the military service. At that time, from
1761 to 1769, James Livingston was sheriff of
Dutchess County, and early in 1763 Henry Ludington
became one of his lieutenants, as sub-sheriff. The
Protestant dynasty in England was so newly established
that elaborate oaths of abjuration and fealty
were still required of all office-holders, of whatever
rank or capacity, and on March 12, 1763, Henry
Ludington, as sub-sheriff, took and subscribed to
them, as follows:</p>

<p>Thus qualified by the taking of these oaths, Henry
Ludington began public services which lasted, in one
capacity and another, for more than a generation in
the Colony and State of New York. The first entry
in his ledger bears date of “May, A.D. 1763,” and
runs as follows: “James Livingston Sheriff Dr to
Serving county writs (seven in number) the price
for serving each writ being from 11s. 9d. to £1—10—9.”
There follow, under dates of October, 1763,
and May, 1764, entries for serving other writs.
Among the names of attorneys in the suits appear
those of Cromwell, Livingston, Jones, Snedeker,
Ludlow, Snook, and Kent; and among those of parties
to suits, etc., are those of Joseph Weeks, Jacob
Ellis, Uriah Hill, Jacob Griffen, George Hughson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Ebenezer Bennett, and Joseph Crane. In 1764 first
appears the name of Beverly Robinson, as the plaintiff
in a suit against one Nathan Birdsall. There is
also mention of a suit brought in the name of the
“Earl of Starling” as plaintiff before the Supreme
Court of the colony—probably William Alexander,
or Lord Stirling, the patriot soldier of the Revolution.</p>

<p>At this home in Frederickstown the children of
Henry and Abigail Ludington, or all of them but
the eldest, were born. These children, with the dates
of their births, were as follows, as recorded by Henry
Ludington in his Family Register, which was inscribed
on a fly-leaf of the ledger already quoted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sibyl, April 5, 1761.</li>
<li>Rebecca, January 24, 1763.</li>
<li>Mary, July 31, 1765.</li>
<li>Archibald, July 5, 1767.</li>
<li>Henry, March 28, 1769.</li>
<li>Derick, February 17, 1771.</li>
<li>Tertullus, Monday night, April 19, 1773.</li>
<li>Abigail, Monday morning, February 26, 1776.</li>
<li>Anne, at sunset, March 14, 1778.</li>
<li>Frederick, June 10, 1782.</li>
<li>Sophia, May 16, 1784.</li>
<li>Lewis, June 25, 1786.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these it is further recorded in the same register
that Sibyl was married to Edward Ogden (the name
is elsewhere given as Edmund or Henry Ogden) on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
October 21, 1784; that Mary was married to David
Travis on September 12, 1785; that Archibald was
married to Elizabeth ⸺ on September 23, 1790;
and that Rebecca was married to Harry Pratt on
May 7, 1794.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

<p>In order justly to appreciate the circumstances in
which Henry Ludington and his young family
found themselves about fifteen years after his return
from the French and Indian war, it will be desirable
to recall briefly the political and social conditions
generally prevailing throughout the Colonies at that
time, which were nowhere more marked than in New
York City and the rural counties lying just north of
it. During the two or three years before the actual
declaration of American independence, or secession
from England, the people of the Colonies were divided
into two parties, the Patriots and the Loyalists
or Tories. The latter maintained the right of England
to govern the Colonies as she pleased, and regarded
even a protest against the maladministration
of George III’s ministers as little short of sacrilege.
The former were by no means as yet committed to the
idea of American separation from the mother country,
but they were most resolute in their demand for
local self-government, and for government according
to the needs of the Colonies rather than the caprices
of English ministers. When they first placed the
legend “Liberty and Union” upon their colonial flag,
and called it the “Grand Union Flag,” they had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mind liberty under the British constitution and continued
union with England. Nevertheless, antagonism
between the two parties became as bitter as ever
it was between Roundhead and Cavalier in Stuart
days; and while in some respects Boston and Philadelphia
figured more conspicuously in the pre-revolutionary
agitation and operations than did New York,
there was probably no place in all the Colonies where
the people were more evenly and generally divided
between the two parties, or where passions rose higher
or were more strongly maintained, than in and about
the last-named city. No ties of neighborliness, friendship,
or even family relationship sufficed to prevent or
to quell the animosities which arose over the political
interests of the Colonies. Nowhere had the Patriots a
more ardent or persuasive leader than young Alexander
Hamilton, or the Tories a more uncompromising
champion than Rivington, the printer, whose office
was at last sacked and gutted by wrathful Patriots.
An illuminating side-light is thrown upon
the New York state of mind by an item in the New
York “Journal” of February 9, 1775, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A company of gentlemen were dining at a
house in New York. One of them used the word
Tory several times. His host asked him, “Pray,
Mr. ⸺, what is a Tory?” He replied, “A Tory
is a thing whose head is in England, and its body
in America, and its neck ought to be stretched!”</p>

</div>

<p>Nor were these passions by any means confined to
the urban but not always urbane community on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Manhattan Island. They prevailed with equal force
in the rural regions of Westchester and Dutchess
counties. During the Revolutionary War that border
region, between the British garrison on Manhattan
Island and the American strongholds in the
Highlands of the Hudson, was the fighting ground
of the belligerents, and was also unmercifully harried
and ravaged by the irregular succors of both sides,
the “Cow Boys” and “Skinners,” and others, celebrated
in the unhappy André’s whimsical ballad of
“The Cow Chase.” Patriots from Westchester
County were foremost among those who wrecked
Rivington’s Tory printing shop, and an aggravated
sequel to the item just cited from the New York
“Journal” is provided in the annals of Dutchess
County a little later in the same year. At that time
a County Committee, or Committee of Safety—of
which we shall presently hear much more—had been
formed in that county, for the purpose of holding the
Tories in check, and it had forcibly deprived some
men of their arms and ammunition. The despoiled
Tories made appeal to the Court of Common Pleas
for redress, and James Smith, a justice of that court,
according to a contemporary narrative, “undertook to
sue for and recover the arms taken from the Tories
by order of said committee, and actually committed
one of the committee who assisted at disarming the
Tories; which enraged the people so much that they
rose and rescued the prisoner, and poured out their
resentment on this villanous retailer of the law.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
“resentment” seems to have been poured out of buckets
and pillows, for we are told that Justice Smith
and his relative, Coen Smith, were “very handsomely
tarred and feathered, for acting in open contempt of
the resolves of the County Committee!”</p>

<p>In or near that part of Dutchess County in which
Henry Ludington lived a third small but not insignificant
factor was involved in the problem. This
was provided by the members of the Society of
Friends, who were settled at Quaker Hill, near
Pawling, in The Oblong. This was the first community
in America to abolish negro slavery, in 1775,
and on that account it was probably regarded with
some suspicion. But worse still was the regard given
to it in the strife between Patriots and Tories. There
can be little doubt that the sentiments and wishes of
the Quakers were largely with the Patriots. Yet
their religious principle of non-resistance forbade
them to take up arms or to engage in forcible conflict
of any kind. They were therefore generally looked
upon by the Patriots as Tories, and were on that account
sometimes fined and otherwise punished, while
on the other hand, the Tories made themselves free to
quarter troops upon them and to demand aid of them
at will. On the whole, however, they appear to have
commanded the respect of the Patriots, for their sincerity,
and thus to have been far more leniently
dealt with than were the more militant Tories outside
the Society of Friends.</p>

</div>

<p>The earliest organization of the Patriots in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
about New York was a Committee of Vigilance, the
chief functions of which were to watch for oppressive
acts of the British Government and incite colonial
protests against them. This was in 1774 superseded
by a Committee of Fifty-One, and it in turn in the
same year gave place to a Committee of Inspection,
of sixty members. In both of these latter John Jay,
who was a neighbor and friend of Henry Ludington,
was conspicuous, and it is to be presumed that Henry
Ludington himself was either a member of the committees
or at least was in active sympathy with their
work. In April, 1775, came a crisis and the turning
point in the movement for independence. The old
Colonial Assembly of New York went out of existence
on April 3. Then came the news of the first
clash of arms at Lexington and Concord, acting as a
spark in a powder-magazine. “Astonished by accounts
of acts of hostility in the moment of expectation
of terms of reconciliation,” said the lieutenant-governor
of New York in his account of the occurrence,
“and now filled with distrust, the inhabitants
of the city burst through all restraint on the arrival of
the intelligence from Boston, and instantly emptied
the vessels laden with provisions for that place, and
then seized the city arms and in the course of a few
days distributed them among the multitude, formed
themselves into companies and trained openly in the
streets; increased the number and power of the committee
before appointed to execute the association of
the Continental Congress, convened themselves by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
beat of the drum for popular resolutions, have taken
the keys of the custom house by military force; shut
up the port, drawn a small number of cannon into the
country; called all parts of the country to a Provincial
Convention; chosen twenty delegates for this
city, formed an association now signing by all ranks,
engaging submission to committees and congresses,
in firm union with the rest of the continent, and
openly avow a resolution not only to resist the acts of
Parliament complained as grievances, but to withhold
succors of all kinds from the troops and to repel
every species of force, wherever it may be exerted,
for enforcing the taxing claims of Parliament at the
risk of their lives and fortunes.” This only half coherent
but wholly intelligible and graphic narrative
tells admirably how the Patriot sentiment of New
York startled into life and action. A year later it
was forcibly repressed by the British garrison on
Manhattan Island, but in the counties at the north it
continued dominant and triumphant.</p>

<p>The “association now signing by all ranks” was
promptly entered into by Henry Ludington and his
neighbors in Dutchess County, as the following
transcript, from the MS. collection of Mr. Patrick,
shows, the date of the original being April 29, 1775:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

of the Measures necessary for its Safety;
and Convinced of the Necessity of preventing the
Anarchy &amp; Confusion which attend the Dissolution

being greatly alarmed at the avowed
Design of the Ministry to raise a Revenue in

and do associate under all the Ties of Religion,

<p>One other signature is illegible. Those of the two
Ludingtons are clear and firm.</p>

<p>The new Provincial Congress of New York met in
the New York City Hall on May 22, 1775, and remained
in session until May 29, its most important
act being the adoption of the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Resolved, That it be and hereby is recommended
to all counties in this colony (who have
not already done it) to appoint County Committees
and also sub-committees for their respective
townships and districts without delay, in order to
carry into execution the resolutions of the Continental
and this Provincial Congress; And that
it is also recommended to every inhabitant of this
colony who has neglected to sign the general association
to do it with all convenient speed, and for
this purpose that the committees in the respective
counties do tender the said association to every inhabitant
within the several districts in each county;
And that the said committees and persons
respectfully do return the said associations and
the names of those who shall refuse to sign the
same to this Congress by the 15th day of June
next, or sooner if possible.</p>

</div>

<p>This obviously “meant business.” It compelled
every inhabitant of the colony to align himself, either
with the Patriots or with the Loyalists; with a certainty
that if he chose the former, he would be held as
a traitor by the British Government, and if he chose
the latter, he would be subject to whatever pains and
penalties his incensed Patriot neighbors might see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
fit to impose upon him. Into the work thus recommended
by the Congress, Henry Ludington entered
with zeal and ardor. He was at the head of the local
committee, in Fredericksburgh Precinct, and also a
member of the Dutchess County Committee, among
his colleagues being John Jay, William Duer, Jacobus
Swartwout, and other eminent Patriots.</p>

<p>How vigorously and unsparingly these committees
went to work will appear if we anticipate for a
moment the chronological record by a year. On a
motion offered by John Jay on June 16, 1776, the
Provincial Congress of New York declared guilty of
treason, with the penalty of death, all persons inhabiting
or passing through the colony, or state, as it
then began to be called, who should give aid or comfort
to the enemy. A week later the Continental
Congress adopted a similar resolution. It does not
appear that this penalty was ever actually imposed,
but the terror of it was held as a powerful measure of
restraint over the Tories. Again, at Conner’s tavern,
at Fishkill, Dutchess County, on October 8, 1776,
there was organized a secret committee “for inquiring
into, detecting and defeating conspiracies …
against the liberties of America,” with full power to
send for persons and papers, call out the militia, and
arrest or expel persons regarded as dangerous to
the state, apparently without any judicial process.
Thereafter numerous parties of suspects were sent in
by the various local committees, including men,
women, and children. All who consented to sign an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
oath of allegiance to Congress were dismissed. The
others were variously dealt with. Some were exiled
from the State, some were imprisoned, and some released
on parole, to remain near Fishkill within call
and surveillance of the committee. The chairman of
this committee was William Duer, and if Henry
Ludington was not actually among its members he
was certainly one of its most trusted and efficient
agents. It continued in existence and action until
February 27, 1777, when it was dissolved by the
State Convention and was replaced by a Board of
Commissioners. Two minutes of the proceedings of
this committee will serve the double purpose of showing
the character of its activities and the part which
Henry Ludington played in executing its decrees.
The first is dated only four days after the organization
of the committee:</p>

</div>

<p>In order to understand clearly the geographical
scope of the operations already and hereafter credited
to Henry Ludington, the division of that part
of Dutchess County into precincts should here be
explained, with the aid of a map. The reference is
to that southern part of Dutchess County which was
afterward set off, as at present, into Putnam County.
From 1737 down to March 24, 1772, it was known as
the South Precinct. On the latter date it was divided
into three longitudinal strips, that along the Hudson
being called Phillipse, or Philipsburgh Precinct; that
in the central and east central part being called Fredericksburgh
Precinct; and the smallest strip at the
extreme east, consisting of part of The Oblong
hitherto mentioned, being known as South East Precinct.
It may be added, in anticipation of the narrative,
that on March 17, 1788, these names were
changed to Philipstown, Frederickstown, and South
East, respectively; that on March 17, 1795, the towns
of Carmel and Franklin were formed from Frederickstown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and the remainder of the last named was
called Fredericks; that on April 6, 1808, Franklin
was changed to Patterson, and on April 15, 1817,
Fredericks was changed to Kent. It may further be
explained that the Philipsburgh Precinct was subdivided
into two nearly equal longitudinal strips, and
the one along the Hudson River was again divided
laterally into three parts, making four lots in all,
which were numbered from 1 to 4, and which in the
partition of the original Phillipse Patent were apportioned
as follows: No. 1, at the extreme southwest,
Susannah Robinson; No. 2, next at the west
center, Philip Phillipse; No. 3, at the northwest,
Mary Phillipse; and No. 4, the long strip inland
from the river, Susannah Robinson. The Fredericksburgh
Precinct was likewise divided into three longitudinal
strips, and the easternmost of them into three
laterally, making five lots in all, numbered from 5 to
9, and these were apportioned as follows: No. 5, the
long strip next to No. 4 of Philipsburg, to Mary
Phillipse; No. 6, a long strip next to No. 5, to Philip
Phillipse; No. 7, a “short lot” at the northeast, to
Susannah Robinson; No. 8, a short lot at the east
center, to Philip Phillipse; and No. 9, a short lot at
the southeast, to Mary Phillipse. When, as we shall
presently see, Henry Ludington became colonel
commanding a militia regiment, his territorial command
included all of these nine lots excepting Nos. 7
and 8. He was thus of all the militia commanders
nearest to the seat of government when it was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Fishkill, and was brought much into contact with
state officials there.</p>

<p>Appreciating the important part which the militia
would play in the conflict which was then seen to be
impending and inevitable, the Provincial Congress
of New York, in session at New York City on August
22, 1775, adopted an elaborate measure for the
enlistment, organization and equipment of such
troops. Every county, city, manor, town, precinct,
and district within the colony was to be divided by a
local committee into districts or beats, in such a manner
that in each beat might be formed one military
company, ordinarily to consist of eighty-three able-bodied
men and officers, between the ages of sixteen
and fifty—afterward sixty—years. Not less than
five nor more than ten such companies were to form
a regiment, and the regiments were to be organized
into brigades. One brigade was to be formed of
the militia of Dutchess and Westchester counties,
commanded by a brigadier-general. It was also
ordered—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That every man between the ages of 16 and 50
do with all convenient speed furnish himself with
a good Musket or firelock &amp; Bayonet Sword or
Tomahawk, a Steel Ramrod, Worm, Priming
Wire and Brush fitted thereto, a Cartouch Box to
contain 23 rounds of cartridges, 12 flints and a
knapsack agreeable to the directions of the Continental
Congress under forfeiture of five shillings
for the want of a musket or firelock and of
one shilling for want of a bayonet, sword or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
tomahawk, cartridgebox, cartridge or bullet.
That every man shall at his place of abode be also
provided with one pound of powder and three
pounds of bullets of proper size to his musket or
firelock.</p>

</div>

<p>There were numerous additional prescriptions,
concerning discipline and drill, the duties and responsibilities
of officers, and the penalties to be imposed
for non-compliance. In case of any alarm,
invasion or insurrection, every man thus enrolled was
immediately to repair to headquarters, to wit, the
home of his captain, and the captain was to march the
company straight to the scene of invasion or insurrection
“to oppose the enemy,” at the same time sending
word to the regimental or brigade commander.
A little later, to wit, on December 20, the Provincial
Congress ordered that the militia of Dutchess and
Westchester counties should form two separate brigades;
whence we may assume that a larger enrolment
of militia men was secured in those counties than had
at first been expected.</p>

<p>The militia were called out whenever needed, and
were kept out as long as they were needed, but they
could be taken outside of the colony or state for no
more than three months at a time. Sometimes, as
Mr. James A. Roberts explains in his work on “New
York in the Revolution,” a regiment or half of a
regiment would be called out half a dozen times
in the course of a year, perhaps for half a dozen days
at a time; and again might not be called out once for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a whole year. The regiments were commonly designated
first by their colonels’ names and next by their
counties. Officers and men seem to have served, says
Mr. Roberts, in different organizations almost indiscriminately.
At one call they were in one and at another
they were in another regiment or company.
Each colonel had almost unlimited powers in the district
to which his regiment belonged, and he was
specially required to see that every able-bodied male
inhabitant between the ages of sixteen and sixty
years was enrolled. Moreover, every such person
must serve whenever called upon to do so, under penalty
of fine and imprisonment; and if incapacitated,
he must contribute toward the cost of securing and
equipping another man. Among the rations served
to all were tobacco, sugar, and tea, and in addition
the colonels and chaplains received liberal allowances
of rum. A colonel’s pay was $75 a month, and a private
soldier’s pay $6.66 a month; not always in
money, but sometimes in state scrip and sometimes
in authority to “impress” cattle and goods; for all
which things taken receipts were to be given to the
owners in the name of the state, so that payment
could afterward be made.</p>

<p>This enactment by New York was made in pursuance
of an act of the Continental Congress, on
July 18, 1775, which “recommended to the inhabitants
of all the united English Colonies in North
America that all able-bodied, effective men between
sixteen and fifty years of age, in each Colony, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
form themselves into regular companies of Militia,
to consist of one captain, two lieutenants, one ensign,
four sergeants, four corporals, one clerk, one drummer,
one fifer, and about sixty-eight privates.”</p>

<p>Each company was permitted to elect its own officers;
the companies were to be formed into regiments
or battalions, officered with a colonel, lieutenant-colonel,
two majors, an adjutant or quartermaster.
All officers above the rank of captain were to
be appointed by the respective Provincial Assemblies,
or Conventions, or by the Committees of
Safety.</p>

<p>One fourth part of the militia in every county was
to consist of minute men, who were ordered “to be
ready on the shortest Notice to march to any Place
where their Assistance may be required for the Defence
of their own or a neighboring Colony.” As the
minute men were expected to be called into action before
the body of the militia were sufficiently trained,
it was recommended “that a more particular and
diligent attention be paid to their instruction in military
discipline.”</p>

<p>The equipment of these militia companies was
at first painfully meager, and their muster-rolls,
“spelled by the unlettered Muse,” were such as
would drive the modern officer to despair. As an example,
the muster-roll of Captain Nathaniel Scribner’s
company may be cited, copied <i>verbatim et literatim</i>
from an original MS. in the possession of Mr.
Charles H. Ludington:</p>

<p>In the work of enlisting and organizing these
militia levies the most efficient men were naturally
those who had already had military experience and
command as officers in some of the colonial wars.
Henry Ludington was among these. He had had
such experience in a noteworthy degree, and to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he added both physical and temperamental aptitude
for military labors, and an ardent spirit of patriotism.
Leaving the service in 1759 as a lieutenant, he
had, as already related, resigned his commission in
indignation at the Stamp Act. On February 13,
1773, however, he accepted a commission as captain
in Colonel Beverly Robinson’s Dutchess County
regiment, and this commission, which was signed by
William Tryon, the last British governor of New
York, he held until 1775, or possibly 1776, when he
cast it aside and entered the “Rebel” or Patriotic
service. The militia of Dutchess County was organized,
under the law already cited, in the fall of 1775,
and on October 17 Petrus Ten Broeck, the colonel
of the First or Rhinebeck and Northwest regiment,
was commissioned brigadier-general commanding.
Of the Second regiment of Dutchess County, Jacobus
Swartwout was colonel, and when in time the
militia of the county was so increased as to form two
brigades, he was, on March 3, 1780, appointed brigadier-general
commanding one of them. Swartwout’s
commission as colonel was also issued on October
17, 1775, and at the same time Malcolm Morrison
was commissioned first major and Henry Ludington
was commissioned second major of his regiment.
Ludington seems also to have served as captain
of the company raised in his home district, and
to have been prompt and energetic in his service; for
on February 20, 1776, we find Colonel Swartwout
in a letter to the Provincial Congress reporting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he was in hourly expectation of Captain Ludington’s
appearance at regimental headquarters, together
with Captains Woodford from Pawling’s,
Clearck from Beekman’s, and Durling from
Rombout Precinct. The Congress the next day ordered
that all the men thus reported should serve until
May 1 of that year, unless sooner discharged.</p>

<p>Soon afterward came Ludington’s first promotion.
On March 8, 1776, Malcolm Morrison, the
first major of Swartwout’s regiment, addressed to
the Provincial Congress of New York this letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Gentlemen: Whereas the gentlemen of the
Provincial Congress has been pleased to appoint
me First Major in Colo. Swartwout’s regiment,
and as my situation and business is such, that it
is not within my power to serve without doing
injustice to myself and creditors, having a considerable
interest in my hands to settle, and having
a large family to take care of without any
person to assist me in settling my affairs, and
whereas Major Henry Ludington, appointed in
the militia, is prevailed upon to accept the commission
sent me, and if agreeable to you, do resign
in his favor. He can be recommended by
Colo. Swartwout or the Committee of Dutchess
County, and I hope you will be prevailed upon
to appoint him in my stead, he being a person
that has served in the last war and well acquainted
in the military service, and, Gentlemen,
your compliance will greatly oblige,</p>

<p>Your Very Humble Servant,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Malcolm Morrison</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Ludington waits for an answer.</p>

<p>N.B. Gentlemen, enclosed you have the commission.</p>

</div>

<p>This extraordinarily naïve and unconventional letter
was received on March 9, apparently being borne
by Major Ludington himself as messenger. It was
favorably acted upon, and the next day, March 10,
Ludington was made first major of the regiment in
Morrison’s place. At this time the companies were
not yet filled, and the regiment was small. But recruiting
went on rapidly, so that by the first of May,
1776, the regiment was actually too large. Accordingly
on May 6 the Committee of Dutchess County
took action for the formation of another regiment in
that part of the county, as reported in the following
letter to the Provincial Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sir:—It having been represented to the General
Committee of this County, that the Southern
Regiment of Militia was too large and extensive,
containing 12 companies and covering a
space of country upwards of 30 miles in length,
we have, therefore, not only because in other
respects it was expedient, but also in compliance
with the Resolution of Congress prohibiting a
Regiment to consist of more than 10 Companies,
divided it, and instead of one have formed the
Militia in that quarter into 2 regiments, together
with a list of persons nominated for Field Officers.
As this part of our Militia will remain unregimented
till the Officers receive their Commissions,
we must request that the Commissions be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
made out as soon as possible and sent to the Committee
in Rombout’s Precinct with directions to
forward them to the Officers immediately.</p>

<p>I remain, by order of the Committee,</p>

<p class="center">Your very humble servant,</p>

<p class="caption">Reduced Fac-simile of the Commission of Henry Ludington as Colonel.</p>

<p class="caption">From the “Provincial Congress for the Colony of New York,” June 1778.</p>
</div>

<p>The new regiment, as described in an enclosure in
Mr. Benson’s letter, was to consist of all the militia
in Phillipse Precinct, and in all of Fredericksburgh
Precinct “except the Northern and Middle Short
Lots”—at the northeast, as hitherto explained. The
field officers nominated were as follows: Colonel,
Moses Dusenbury; lieutenant-colonel, Henry Ludington;
first major, Reuben Ferris; second major,
Joshua Nelson; adjutant, Joshua Myrick; quartermaster,
Solomon Hopkins. These nominations were
promptly confirmed. A little later Henry Ludington
was commissioned colonel of this regiment, to
succeed Colonel Dusenbury. The exact date is not
now ascertainable, but according to the mutilated remains
of the commission, a facsimile of which is given
in this volume, it was some time in June, 1776. The
commission—his first as colonel—was issued by the
Provincial Congress of the Colony of New York,
and was one of the last acts of that body, which in
that month of June, 1776, went out of existence, and
on July 9 following was succeeded by a new Provincial
Congress, meeting at White Plains, which the
next day, July 10, changed its name to the Convention
of the Representatives of the State of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
York. With this change of government new commissions
were issued to officers, Henry Ludington
receiving one as colonel, which is now in the possession
of his grandson, Charles H. Ludington. His
regiment, the seventh of the Dutchess County militia,
was thereafter popularly known and indeed
often officially designated as Colonel Ludington’s
regiment. Unfortunately its earliest muster-rolls and
record of organization have not been preserved, or
cannot now be found, but it is known to have consisted
of six companies. The minutes of the Council
of Appointment do not mention it until May 28,
1778, when it is called Colonel Henry Ludington’s
regiment. At this latter date Stephen Ludington
was a second lieutenant in Captain Joel Mead’s
(1st) company. We may here add that in various
rosters of New York troops the following names of
members of the Ludington family appear, in addition
to Colonel Ludington:</p>

<p>Stephen Ludington, and also Stephen Ludenton
(doubtless the same person), private, in Brinckerhoff’s
company of Brinckerhoff’s regiment—the second
regiment of Dutchess County, Rombout Precinct.</p>

<p>Elisha Luddington, private, of Livingston’s company
of Malcolm’s regiment—the first regiment of
New York levies in the United States Army. Also,
Elisha Luddington, private, in Barnum’s company
of Hopkins’s regiment—the sixth regiment of
Dutchess County.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>William Luddington, private, in Westfall’s company
of Wessenfels’s regiment.</p>

<p>Comfort Ludington, private, in Hecock’s company
of Field’s regiment—the third regiment of
Dutchess County. Also, Comfort Ludington, private,
in Mead’s company of Ludington’s regiment—the
seventh regiment of Dutchess County. Also,
Comfort Luddington, captain of a company of the
second regiment of minute men of Dutchess County,
commissioned on February 26, 1776.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1776, probably at about the time of
Colonel Ludington’s appointment, and a month before
the formal declaration of American independence,
the Continental Congress called for 13,800
militia from the Colonies, to reënforce the army at
New York, in addition to other levies for the army
which was to invade Canada. New York’s share of
this levy was 3,750, of whom 3,000 were for service
at New York and 750 for the expedition to Canada.
The latter were naturally selected from the northern
counties, while the 3,000 for local service were taken
from the counties along the Hudson and around the
city of New York. Among the latter were 335 men
from Dutchess County, a larger number than was
contributed by any other county excepting New
York and Albany. The Dutchess County contingent
was ordered to be ready to march on
June 21.</p>

<p class="caption">(Original in possession of Charles H. Ludington, New York City.)</p>
</div>

<p>The local needs of Dutchess County were not,
however, to be overlooked. A committee of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
York Congress on June 20 reported that there were
many disaffected and dangerous persons in Dutchess
and Westchester counties, who greatly disturbed the
peace, and who would probably take up arms whenever
the enemy should make a descent upon that
region, and that the requisitions of troops made by
the Continental Congress had left the militia incapable
of keeping peace and order “without great inconvenience
to themselves and much injury to and
neglect of their private property.” It was therefore
recommended, and ordered, that 100 men and officers
in Dutchess County and 50 in Westchester County
be taken into the service of the Provincial Congress
“and confined to the Service of those Counties.” The
100 men in Dutchess County were organized in two
companies. On July 16 the Provincial Congress, or
Convention, was in session at White Plains, and it
there ordered that one fourth of the militia of those
two counties should be summoned into active service,
until the end of the year; each man receiving $20
bounty, and the same pay and subsistence as the Continental
soldiers. Among those thus drawn into the
service was Colonel Ludington.</p>

<p>The first care of Colonel Ludington on assuming
command of his regiment was to fill up its ranks and
organize a complete staff of officers. In reporting to
the Convention—or Provincial Congress, as he still
called it—upon this work, he wrote under date of
July 19, 1776, from Fredericksburgh, as follows, this
letter being transformed into modern and corrected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
orthography, and others which follow being thus
edited only enough to insure intelligibility:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>These may inform Your Honors that I meet
with some difficulty in furnishing my quota of
men for the present emergency, for want of commissions
in the regiment which I have the honor
to command. We have a number of officers
chosen already that have no commissions, and
several more must be chosen in order to have the
regiment properly officered. And whereas I have
applied to the County Committee for blanks to be
filled up, and there are none to be had, therefore
I, in conjunction with the committee of this Precinct,
would desire that there might be about
twenty blank commissions sent up by Mr.
Myrick, the bearer hereof. I would further acquaint
Your Honors that the regiment is destitute
of Majors, and would be glad if Your Honors
would appoint two gentlemen to that office
and fill up commissions for them. There are two
gentlemen that I do, with the advice of the Committee,
nominate, viz., Mr. Gee—his Christian
name I am not able to tell—of Phillipse Precinct,
and Captain Ebenezer Robinson of this
Precinct. These gentlemen are doubtless known
by several of the members of the honorable
House.</p>

<p>The annals of the New York Convention, under
date of July 20, 1776, relate that this letter was received,
read, and filed, and that—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On reading the said letter from Colonel
Ludenton, of Dutchess County, and considering
the state of his Regiment at this critical time,</p>

<p>Resolved, That Commissions be issued to the
two gentlemen therein named in said letter, and
that 20 other Commissions be signed by the President
and countersigned by one of the Secretaries
and transmitted to Colonel Ludenton, to be filled
up for the Captains and Subalterns of his Regiment
when necessary, by the Precinct Committee
and himself; that said Precinct Committee and
Colonel Ludenton return to this Convention an
exact list of the names, rank and dates of the
Officers commissioned, which they shall fill up
and deliver.</p>

<p>And Resolved, That the sending blank commissions
to a Precinct Committee shall not from
this instance be drawn into precedent.</p>

</div>

<p>In this fashion Colonel Ludington prepared for
the stern activities before him. The “critical time”
referred to in the resolutions of the Convention was
indeed critical. New York was in imminent danger
of being occupied by the British, and British warships
were likely soon to ascend the Hudson River.
John Jay was intrusted with the making of plans for
the defense of the Hudson Highlands. On August
1, Jay, Duer, and others, were made a committee to
draft a plan for a new government for the State of
New York. The battle of Long Island was fought
on August 27, and a little later the British were in
full possession of New York and its environs. The
Convention was driven to Harlem, to Kingsbridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to Odell’s in Phillipse Manor, to Fishkill, to Poughkeepsie,
and to Kingston. On October 20 the battle
of Chatterton Hill was fought, at White Plains, in
which Colonel Ludington’s regiment was engaged,
and in which he himself served as one of Washington’s
aides, and thus began his acquaintance with the
commander-in-chief. When Washington’s army
crossed the Hudson River, however, for the “devil’s
dance across the Jerseys,” and the superb turning at
bay at Trenton, the New York militia levies remained
at home, where indeed they were sorely
needed. The Tory element in Westchester and
Dutchess counties had from the first been ominously
strong. With the British victories in and around
New York, and with the American Army in apparently
hopeless rout and flight, they were emboldened
to open hostility to the Patriot cause. A report to
the Convention, or to the Committee of Safety, on
September 4, made it appear that in the four counties
of Dutchess, Westchester, Orange and Ulster
there were only 3,100 armed and trustworthy militia,
while there were 2,300 disaffected Tories and 2,300
slaves to be held in order. A month later the situation
was much worse, and it was then that there was
formed the committee already mentioned, “for inquiring
into, detecting and defeating conspiracies
against the liberties of America.” The war was now
on, in earnest, and “malice domestic, foreign levy,”
were both at once to be grappled with by the Patriot
soldiers.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

<p>The public services of Henry Ludington during
the war for independence were threefold in
character. Each of the three parts was of much importance,
each was marked with arduous toil and frequent
perils, and each was performed to the full
extent of his ability. Nor was the sacrifice of personal
welfare inconsiderable. We have seen that he
was the father of a large family, eight children having
been born to him prior to the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, and was the leasehold
occupant of extensive lands. It was no light thing
to absent himself from these. There was before
him, moreover, the example of another and senior
officer, who, because of family interests and engagements,
had resigned his commission. That same
commission had been passed on to Henry Ludington,
who might with equal grace and reason have declined
it or presently resigned it. There is, however, no indication
that he ever contemplated such a step.
Leaving his lands and home in the charge of his wife
and children, the eldest of whom in 1776 was only
fifteen, while the youngest was a babe in arms, he
gave himself with whole-hearted devotion to whatever
tasks his country might require of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The distinctively military services of Henry Ludington
began at an early date. The first clash of
arms after the Declaration of Independence occurred
on the shores of New York Bay. The retirement
of the American Army, after unsuccessful engagements,
from Long Island, and then from Manhattan
Island, brought the theater of war closer and
closer to Dutchess County, and made the active participation
of the militia more imminent. Indeed, even
before those operations, the militia was called out to
assist in securing the passes of the Hudson Highlands,
and thus preventing any communication between
the British at New York and those in Canada
and the North Woods. The Convention or Legislature
of the State, in session at Harlem, on August
8, 1776, adopted the following war measure:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>RESOLVED unanimously that Brigadier
General Clinton be, and he hereby is, appointed
to the Command of all the Levies raised, and to
be raised in the Counties of Ulster, Orange and
West Chester, agreeable to the Resolutions of
this Convention of the sixteenth day of July last.</p>

<p>RESOLVED that General Clinton be informed
of this Appointment and directed immediately
to send Expresses to the Counties of Ulster,
Dutchess, Orange and West Chester, and
order them to hasten their Levies and to march
them down to the Fort now erected on the North
side of Kings Bridge, leaving two hundred men
under the Command of a Brave &amp; alert Officer to
take possession of and throw up works at the pass
of Anthonys Nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>RESOLVED that General Clinton be requested
to order the Troops of Horse belonging
to the Counties of Ulster, Orange and West
Chester immediately to march to such posts as he
may think proper that they should Occupy, in
order to watch the motions of the Enemies Ships
of war now in Hudsons River.</p>

<p>When the ships of war had landed an army, and
this was moving irresistibly northward, a committee
of the Convention, meeting at Fishkill as a Committee
of Safety, on October 10, further ordered:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>RESOLVED, that the Commanding officer

send down 300 men of the Militia of the County
of Ulster, to Peekskill well armed and accoutred
with three days provisions.</p>

<p>RESOLVED, that the Commanding Officer
on the south side of the Mountains or High-Lands
in the County of Orange, be directed to order
such a number of the militia from that part of the
said County which lays on the south side of the
High Lands as will be sufficient to Guard their
shores, and to appoint a commissioner to supply
them with provisions.</p>

<p>And that the Commanding Officer on the north
side of the Highlands, in the said County, Order
one hundred of the Militia from the north side of
the High Lands of the said County to march
without Delay to Peekskill taking with them
three days provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>RESOLVED that Benjamin Haight and
Mathew Harper be commissioners to supply
them with provisions, and that this Convention
will provide means for defraying the Expense.</p>

<p>ORDERED, that the Brigadier Generals of
the Counties of Albany, Dutchess, Ulster and
Orange, give orders to the several Colonels in
their Brigades to hold the one half of their several
Regiments in Readiness to march at an
hour’s notice with five days provisions.</p>

<p>RESOLVED, that all Ranges raised in the
County of Ulster repair immediately to Fishkill

</div>

<p>The turning-point in the campaign which began
at Brooklyn occurred on October 28, at White
Plains. There, at Chatterton Hill, Washington
once more engaged the British, and once more was
compelled to retire before them. With the masterly
strategy in which he was unrivaled by any soldier of
his time, however, instead of falling back upon the
defenses of the Hudson Highlands and thus inviting
a conflict which might have cost him the possession of
that crucial point, he retreated in another direction,
south and west, thus drawing the British away from
the Highlands and leaving the latter secure. Had
the British, instead of pursuing him in that fruitless
chase across the Jerseys, only to meet with disaster at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Trenton, hurled themselves against the forts at
West Point and elsewhere along the Hudson, they
might easily have gained control of the Hudson, and
thus have effected a junction with their northern
forces and have altered the whole story of the war.
We may suppose that that is what Washington would
have done had he been in Clinton’s place. The British
did not do so, but fell into the trap which the wily
American had set for them. In the battle at White
Plains, however,—which is more to our purpose than
the subsequent campaign,—the militia was largely
used, and acquitted itself with credit. In an application
for a pension made by Joshua Baker of
Dutchess County, it was set forth that “On or about
the 1st day of August, 1776, he enlisted at a place
called Fredericksburgh in the County of Dutchess
and State of New York at which place he was residing.
That he entered the company commanded by
Captain Luddenton in the regiment commanded by
Col. Swartwout. That from Fredericksburgh aforesaid
he marched with the said company to Peekskill
and after a short time from thence to Kingsbridge
in the county of Westchester, that he remained at
Kingsbridge until the month of October, when they
were ordered to White Plains, where he was in the
engagement generally known as the battle of White
Plains. In this engagement one of the Chaplains
named Van Wyck was killed. Soon after the battle
of White Plains he marched with the said regiment
to New Windsor where he was discharged.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“Captain Luddenton” mentioned was presumably
Comfort Ludington, who, as we have already seen,
was an officer of the Dutchess County militia, and
the statement of Baker is clear indication that that
militia was engaged in the battle of White Plains.</p>

<p>Further evidence to the same effect, directly connecting
Henry Ludington with that battle, is found
in the affidavit of Elisha Turner, who declared
“That in the fall of 1776 he was drafted for three
months in Captain Joel Mead’s Company, Lieut.
Porter, and Seargents Fisher and Brewsters in
Colonel Ludington’s Reg’t New York State troops.
That he joined his company and marched to White
Plains and then joined his regiment and the Army,
that he was present at the battle of White Plains and
afterward retired with the army up the river. That
he remained with his Regiment and company until
his term of three months expired, when he received a
verbal discharge from his Colonel and Captain and
returned home.” Much other evidence to the same
effect might be cited, were it needed, which it is not.
There can be no doubt that Henry Ludington with
his regiment was engaged at White Plains, and that
he, himself, as a representative officer of the Dutchess
County levies, was chosen to serve as an aide on the
staff of Washington. The commander-in-chief appears
to have recognized in Colonel Ludington a man
upon whose brain and arm he might with confidence
depend. It is a credible tradition that during that
battle Washington complimented him upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
soldier-like bearing, and indirectly paid a tribute to his
vigilance. A family tradition tells that as the two
stood side by side, with the rest of the staff about
them, Colonel Ludington noticed the British taking
up a new position and placing their artillery,
screened behind shrubs and trees, and directed Washington’s
attention to the fact, which had been entirely
unperceived by the others. “Yes,” said Washington,
approvingly, “I have been watching them
this long time.”</p>

<p>On November 6, the British began their fatuous
movement toward New Jersey, imagining that the
American Congress at Philadelphia, rather than the
American Army and fortresses along the Hudson,
was the strategical objective. The American Council
of War unanimously agreed that Washington’s
army should thereupon cross into New Jersey, anticipating
the British advance, while three thousand
troops, including Colonel Ludington’s Dutchess
County militia, should be sent to reinforce the defenses
of the Highlands. Washington left White
Plains on the morning of November 10, and reached
Peekskill at sunset of the same day, Colonel Ludington’s
regiment presumably accompanying him.
After a careful inspection of the works as far up the
river as West Point, and after giving directions for
the disposition of the troops, on November 12 he
passed over into New Jersey, and went his way to
the disaster of Fort Washington, and the more than
redeeming victory of Trenton. Meanwhile, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Ludington remained at Peekskill, where there presently
was a prospect of strenuous work. For having,
as they imagined, put Washington to hopeless
flight in New Jersey, the British turned a part of their
attention to the very thing to which their chief attention
should at the outset have been given. Plans
were made for an advance up the Hudson, by land
and water. West Point was to be avoided by
marching up the east shore, where the defenses were
not so strong. Such a movement must, of course, be
resisted at all hazards. Washington, from his camp
on the Delaware, in what Thomas Paine described as
“the times that try men’s souls,” was able to spare
enough attention from his own pressing extremities
to write words of warning and exhortation to Governor
Clinton, and in pursuance of his wise counsels
the New York Convention, at Fishkill, on December
21, adopted the following resolutions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>WHEREAS, from various Intelligence received
of the motions and Designs of the Enemy’s
Army, it appears highly probable that they meditate
an attack upon the Passes in the Highlands
on the East side of Hudson’s River,</p>

<p>AND WHEREAS, the Term of the Enlistment
of the militia under the command of Brigadier
General George Clinton which is at present
stationed to defend the Pass at Peeks Kill expires
on the last of this month, and that a great
part of the Division commanded by Major General
Spencer, which is stationed at North Castle
on the 29th inst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>AND WHEREAS, his Excellency Genl.
Washington by his Letter of the 15th instant has
warmly recommended to this state to exert themselves
in procuring temporary supplies of militia
’till the new Levies of the continental army can
be brought into the Field,</p>

<p>RESOLVED, that the whole militia of the
Counties of Westchester, Dutchess and that part
of the County of Albany which lies to the southward
of Beeren Island be forthwith marched to
North Castle in Westchester County, well
equipped with arms and ammunition and furnished
with Blankets &amp; six days Provisions &amp; a
Pot or Camp Kettle to every six men, except
such Persons as the field Officers of the Respective
Regiments shall judge cannot be called into
service without greatly distressing their families,
or who may be actually engaged in the manufacturing
of salt Petre, or of shoes and Cloathing
for the use of the army.</p>

<p>RESOLVED, that the said militia be allowed
continental Pay and Rations, and that such men
as cannot furnish themselves with arms shall be
supplied from the continental store.</p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Ludington and his regiment therefore remained
on duty at North Castle until word came of
the rout of the British at Trenton and Princeton, and
Washington’s triumphant return to the hills of Morristown
for the winter. All imminent danger of a
British attack upon the Highlands was then past, and
the militia was permitted to return home for a time.
The respite was brief, however. On January 3,
1777, Nathaniel Sackett was authorized by the Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of Safety “to employ such detachments of the
militia of Dutchess County as are not in actual service,
as he may deem expedient, for inquiring into,
detecting and defeating all conspiracies which may
be found against the liberties of America.” Also,
on March 25, the Convention took further action, resulting
in the issuance of this order by Governor
Clinton:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To Colonel Morris Graham,</p>

<p>Pursuant to a Resolve of the Honorable the
Convention of the State of New York, dated the
25th day of March last, impowering &amp; requiring
me until the first of August next to call into
actual Service all or any Part or proportion of the
Militia as well Horse as Foot of the Counties of
Ulster, West Chester, Dutchess and Orange, for

<p>Colonel Ludington appears at this time not to have
been among those called to duty at Peekskill, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
have been left for a few weeks among those “not in
actual service” who were to act under Nathaniel
Sackett, as already related, for the suppression of
conspiracies. The call to duty was not very well
responded to by the other officers and men. The
militia had been in the field in the early part of the
winter longer than they had expected to be, and now,
in the spring, they were desirous of remaining at
home as much as possible to attend to the season’s
work on their farms. This reluctance to respond to
the call provoked this action of the Convention, taken
at Kingston on April 24:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>WHEREAS it appears that a great Part of
the militia of Dutchess County have neglected to
obey the orders of General Clinton issued in consequence
of a resolve of this House, for calling
out a part of the militia of the Counties of Ulster,
Orange and Dutchess to Garrison the forts
and Guard the passes in the Highlands.</p>

<p>RESOLVED that Major Lawrence and Mr.
Zephaniah Platt be &amp; they are hereby appointed
a Committee to repair forthwith to Dutchess
County to enquire into the reasons of such neglect,
that they use their utmost endeavours to convince
the People of the necessity of exerting
themselves at this critical Juncture, and that they
make report to this Convention with all convenient
Dispatch in order that the most effectual
measures may be taken to induce a compliance
with the aforesaid Resolve.</p>

<p>RESOLVED that General Clinton be &amp; he

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Robt. Benson</span>, <i>Secry.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There was, however, no question concerning the
activity and zeal of Colonel Ludington at this time.
On April 25, the very day after the adoption of the
foregoing resolution by the Convention, a force of
two thousand British troops landed at Compo, near
Fairfield, Connecticut, under command of General
Tryon, the former British governor of New York,
under whom Henry Ludington had once held a commission.
It marched hastily inland, and on the afternoon
of the next day reached Danbury, Connecticut,
where there were large stores of provisions, tents,
etc., for the American Army, many of which had
been sent thither from Peekskill for—as was supposed—greater
security. Not only these, but also
most of the private houses in the town, were at once
set afire, while the soldiers made themselves drunk
with looted spirits, and gave themselves up to an
unrestrained orgy. It was one of the most brutal
and disgraceful performances of British arms in all
the war, and was unhesitatingly denounced as such
by self-respecting British officers. It does not appear
that the raid had any other object than the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of Danbury, or the stores at that place, for as
soon as the soldiers could be sufficiently sobered up
thereafter, a retreat toward the British shipping on
the Sound was begun. But on the American side the
incident gave occasion for one of the most thrilling
and gallant exploits of the war.</p>

<p>It was on Friday afternoon that the landing was
made at Compo, and it was on Saturday afternoon
that Danbury was burned. Patriot messengers rode
at top speed in three directions—toward New Haven
to hasten Generals Arnold and Wooster, who were
already on their way; to meet General Silliman, to
expedite his juncture with the others; and to Fredericksburgh
to tell the news to Colonel Ludington, that
he might furnish the troops which the generals would
need. Railroads, telegraphs and other annihilators
of time and space were unknown in those days. But
the personal factor, which after all dominates all the
problems of this world, was active and effective. At
four o’clock Danbury was fired. At eight or nine
o’clock that evening a jaded horseman reached Colonel
Ludington’s home with the news. We may
imagine the fire that flashed through the veteran’s
veins at the report of the dastardly act of his former
chief. But what to do? His regiment was disbanded,
its members scattered at their homes, many
at considerable distances. He must stay there, to
muster all who came in. The messenger from Danbury
could ride no more, and there was no neighbor
within call. In this emergency he turned to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
daughter Sibyl, who, a few days before, had passed
her sixteenth birthday, and bade her to take a horse,
ride for the men, and tell them to be at his house by
daybreak. One who even now rides from Carmel to
Cold Spring will find rugged and dangerous roads,
with lonely stretches. Imagination only can picture
what it was a century and a quarter ago, on a dark
night, with reckless bands of “Cowboys” and “Skinners”
abroad in the land. But the child performed
her task, clinging to a man’s saddle, and guiding her
steed with only a hempen halter, as she rode through
the night, bearing the news of the sack of Danbury.
There is no extravagance in comparing her ride with
that of Paul Revere and its midnight message. Nor
was her errand less efficient than his. By daybreak,
thanks to her daring, nearly the whole regiment was
mustered before her father’s house at Fredericksburgh,
and an hour or two later was on the march for
vengeance on the raiders. They were a motley company,
some without arms, some half dressed, but all
filled with a certain berserk rage. That night they
reached Redding, and joined Arnold, Wooster and
Silliman. The next morning they encountered the
British at Ridgefield. They were short of ammunition
and were outnumbered by the British three to
one. But they practised the same tactics that Paul
Revere’s levies at Lexington and Concord found so
effective. Their scattering sharpshooter fire from
behind trees and fences and stone walls, harassed the
British sorely, and made their retreat to their ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
at Compo resemble a rout. Nor were instances of individual
heroism in conflict lacking. Arnold had his
horse shot under him as, almost alone, he furiously
charged the enemy, and the gallant Wooster received
a wound from which he died a few days later. There
were far greater operations in the war than this, but
there was scarcely one more expeditious, intrepid and
successful. Writing of it to Gouverneur Morris,
Alexander Hamilton said: “I congratulate you on
the Danbury expedition. The stores destroyed there
have been purchased at a pretty high price to the
enemy. The spirit of the people on the occasion does
them great honor—is a pleasing proof that they have
lost nothing of that primitive zeal with which they
began the contest, and will be a galling discouragement
to the enemy from repeating attempts of the
kind.… The people of New York considered the
affair in the light of a defeat to the British troops.”</p>

<p class="caption">View of highroad and plains from site of Colonel Ludington’s house</p>
</div>

<p>It was not long before there was a still more
serious menace than the Danbury raid. In June,
1777, there were indications that the British were
planning anew to gain possession of the Hudson
River, and thus unite their own northern and southern
forces while dividing the eastern from the middle
and southern colonies. Colonel Ludington and his
regiment were therefore summoned to Peekskill, to
strengthen the defenses of the Highlands, and it
was not without some difficulty that he was enabled
to respond to the call. Some of his men had become
half mutinous. They had been willing enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
rush to Danbury, but now, in the busy time of the
early summer, they objected to leaving their farms
when there was no enemy actually in sight. The
same trouble was experienced by the other militia
commanders. On this occasion the period of service
at Peekskill was short. But on July 1, Washington
wrote to Clinton that the British were believed to be
operating against Ticonderoga and its dependencies;
that Howe was preparing to evacuate the Jerseys to
coöperate with the northern army, and that there
was danger of a sudden attack upon the Highlands
and the passes of the Hudson. He urged therefore,
in the strongest manner, that all available militia
should be called out to strengthen the garrisons at
Peekskill and other places on the river. The next
day Governor Clinton reported the gist of this letter
to the Committee of Safety, adding that in consequence
thereof he had “issued Orders to Colonels
Brinckerhoff, Ludington, Umphrey &amp; Freeze of
Dutchess County to march their Regiments to
Peek’s Kill.” But the result was not altogether satisfactory.
The men were ready enough for active
service; but they demurred at waiting idly in the
camp while their farms at home were suffering. On
July 9, Clinton, in a quandary, wrote from Fort
Montgomery to the president of the Convention:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Militia which I ordered to this Post &amp;
who came in with great Expedition almost to a
Man according to Custom begin to be extreamly
uneasy. They want to go Home, their Corn is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
suffering, their Harvest coming on, and they
cant see that it is likely there will be any Thing
for them to do here suddenly. They have been
frequently on the Dunderbergh to look down the
River &amp; cant see a single Vessel in it; What shall
I do with them?</p>

<p>If I consent to their going Home they will Return
when ordered again with great Chearfulness.
If I dont, they will go (many of them at
least) without Leave. I dont know what to do
with them &amp;, therefore, shall not do any Thing,
without your Honor’s Directions which I should
be glad to have this afternoon.</p>

</div>

<p>As a result of this appeal, General Putnam on
July 11 issued an order to the effect that, “considering
the Busy Season of the Year, &amp; how important it
is to the public as well as to themselves that the
Militia be at home in their Business at this Time, and
not being wanted, Altho’ he cannot say how soon they
may be,” the three regiments which first responded
to the call, to wit, Ludington’s, Humphrey’s and
Brinckerhoff’s, were “dismissed with the General’s
thanks for their Alertness and for their good Services,
relying upon it that the Zeal &amp; Ardor they have
shewn in the great Cause we are engaged in will
prompt them to turn out without (<i>sic</i>) the utmost
Alacrity on all future Occasions.”</p>

<p>Another occasion was quickly supplied by the
British, with their activities at the north and their renewed
menace against the Highlands. On June 30,
General Howe evacuated New Jersey, moved into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Staten Island, and prepared to advance up the Hudson.
On July 1, Burgoyne with his army appeared
before Ticonderoga, and on July 6, the Americans
evacuated that fortress. Washington, then at Morristown,
wrote on July 10 to the president of the
Continental Congress: “In consequence of the probability
that General Howe will push against the
Highland passes to cooperate with General Burgoyne,
I shall, by the advice of my officers, move the
army from hence to-morrow morning towards the
North River.” Though delayed somewhat by bad
weather, he proceeded to Sufferns, and thence to
Galloway’s, in Orange County, New York, where he
remained until he ascertained that Howe was not
going up the river, but was really making a feint to
cover a swift dash upon Philadelphia. Accordingly,
on July 23, Washington’s army was set in motion
toward the Delaware, leaving the Highlands to their
local defenders. The inefficient and half treacherous
Gates presently superseded Schuyler in command
of the American Army at the north after the
disastrous affair at Ticonderoga, and it is probable
that Washington doubted his ability to cope with
Burgoyne. At any rate, despite what he regarded
as Howe’s “unaccountable abandonment” of Burgoyne,
Washington regarded the latter’s movements
with much apprehension, and frequently warned
Clinton at the Highlands to be on his guard against
him. On July 31, he urged Clinton to call out the
militia to reinforce the garrisons, and Clinton wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as follows to the Committee of Safety, a letter which
throws much light upon the embarrassments from
which he suffered:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Proportion to be furnished by this State
is 500 and it shall be my first Business to issue the
necessary Orders for march’g them to the respective
stations for which they are intended.</p>

<p>I am nevertheless apprehensive that I shall
find it extremely difficult to compleat even this
small Number. The Continental Pay and Rations
being far below the wages given for ordinary
Labor the Difference becomes a Tax rendered
by personal Service and as the Train Band
List from the Exemptions arising from Age Office
&amp; other Causes consists chiefly of the Middling
&amp; lower Class of People this extraordinary
Tax is altogether paid by them.</p>

<p>Add to this that unless a proportionate Number
is called out of each County which in most
Cases is inexpedient the County affording the
most Men is upon the same Principle charged
with a Tax to which the other Parts of the Community
do not contribute.</p>

<p>These Reasons are so clear as to be generally
understood and complained of by the Militia and
unless those exercising the Legislative Power of
the State shall in their Wisdom devise some Plan
in which those Inconveniences will be obviated
and the Militia Duty become more equal I am extremely
apprehensive that any Orders for calling
Detachments to the Field for a limited Time will
not hereafter be so duly obeyed as the Nature of
Military Command and the good of the service
absolutely requires. It wo’d be needless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
observe to you, Gentlemen, that tho my Office as
Governor gives me the Command of the Militia I
am not vested with authority to promise even the
ordinary Continental Pay and subsistance to any
greater Number of Men than those required of
me by his Excellency the Commander in Chief,
whose Requisition entitles those who are called
into actual Service in Consequence thereof to a
Compensation from the Continent at large.</p>

</div>

<p>In consequence of this letter of Clinton’s the Committee
of Safety the same day ordered that “Continental
pay and rations be advanced on behalf of the
Continent, to all such Militia as his Excellency the
Governor shall think proper to call out.” Colonel
Ludington was not included in the summons to the
Highlands, but was selected by Clinton for other
and, as it proved, actually more active service, in the
borderland of Westchester County. Clinton wrote
to him as follows, from Kingston, on August 1, 1777:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Operations of the Enemy ag’t the State
to the Northward as well as the exposed Situation
of some of the Southern Counties to the Incursions
of the Enemy from that Quarter, render
it expedient to call into actual Service, a very
considerable Proportion of the Militia in the
Classing of the different Regiments for these
Services your Regiment &amp; Colo. Fields’ with the
other Regiments of W. Chester County are to
furnish 310 Men, including Non Commissioned
Officers &amp; Privates properly officered armed &amp;
accoutred, as you’l see by the inclosed Order;
and, as you are appointed to take the command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
this Detachment, I desire that you will, immediately
upon the Receipt hereof, direct and forward
to the Commanding Officers of the other Regiments
who are to furnish Men towards this Detachm’t,
one of the inclosed Resolutions &amp; Orders,
and exert yourself in having them raised with all
possible Expedition and march them to such Stations
in W. Chester County as will tend most to
the Protection of the Inhabitants and best conduce
to the Public Safety. Taking your Directions
occasionally from the Command’g Officer
at Peeks Kill.</p>

<p>The Inclosed Resolutions of the Council of
Safety subjecting Exempts to a Proportion of
the Common Burthen will, I hope, enable you to
carry these Orders into Execution with greater
Ease, especially as every Other Regt. in the State
will furnish an equal if not a greater Number of
Men for the Service.</p>

<p class="center">I am &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sig">(G. C.)</p>

<p class="noindent">Colo. Ludington.</p>

<p>The Troops will be allowed Continental Pay
&amp; Rations &amp; a Bounty to be raised agreeable to
the within Resolve from the Fines levied on the
Exempts refusing Service.</p>

</div>

<p>A few days later another alarm was caused by the
uncertainty which attended the movements of the
British fleet, which, after sailing from New York to
the capes of the Delaware as if to attack Philadelphia,
suddenly put to sea again and disappeared
for a time. Washington communicated his observations
and suspicions to Clinton, and Clinton, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
August 5, countermanded his orders to Ludington in
the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By Dispatches just Rec’d from his Excellency
Genl. Washington dated at Chester in Pensylvania
1st Aug’t, I am informed that the Enemy’s
Fleet have left the Capes of Delaware &amp; are
steering Eastward &amp; his Excellency is fully of
Opinion they intend (proceeding) up Hudson’s
River. From this Intelligence &amp; the great Preparations
making by the Enemy at Kings Bridge
for an Expedition, I have not the least Doubt but
that their Designs are against this Quarter &amp; by
vigorous Exertion they hope to join their two
Armies before ours can arrive to oppose them.
His Excellency is apprehensive of this also &amp; has
requested me to call out all the Militia of this
State to oppose the Enemy till he can arrive with
his Army. You will, therefore, on receipt hereof
with the utmost Expedition march your Regt. to
Fort Montgomery compleatly armed and accoutred,
leaving the frontier Companies at Home
embodied &amp; on Duty to guard ag’t any small
Parties of Tories or Indians. I mean to repair to
the Fort with all Expedition &amp; take the Command.</p>

</div>

<p>Clinton then notified Putnam at Peekskill that he
had ordered Ludington’s and also Field’s and
Brinckerhoff’s regiments to join him forthwith, and
on August 9 reported this action to Washington.
But it was one thing to order and another thing to
have the order fulfilled. The militia exhibited their
former reluctance to go into camp unless the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
were actually in sight. This applies, however, to the
other regiments rather than to Colonel Ludington’s.
No complaint of his inactivity or his inability to furnish
his quota of men appears. But on August 20,
Colonel Humphrey reported that his regiment was
unwilling to march northward, meaning, no doubt,
to go up the river beyond the Highlands to the aid of
Gates against Burgoyne, as there was some desperate
talk of doing; and John Jay and Gouverneur Morris
reported that Gates’s army could hope for no militia
reinforcements excepting from Albany County, and
that garrisons should be provided for the Highland
forts when the terms of enlistment of the militia
should expire. This was the more essential as the
regular garrisons had largely been sent north to aid
Gates. A little later, on September 4, Colonel Dirck
Brinckerhoff wrote from Fishkill to Clinton in answer
to some strictures as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>You Blame me in Your Letter for Disobeying
the Orders I first Receiv’d for all the Militia to
go to Peekskill, but it was by Consent of General
Putnam, that Only part should go, and be Reliev’d
by the Same number from time to time in
Such Manner as I thought proper, which has
Strictly been done.</p>

<p>Agreeable to your Last I have Order’d half the
Militia out, but it is allmost impossible to get
them to go, on account of the Exempts not going,
Aledging this is not a General Alarum; therefore,
should be Glad of Some further Regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in that Respect, and Possitive Orders from you
how to act in that affair, I am Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your Ob’t. Hble. Serv’t</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Dirck Brinckerhoff</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">To His Excellency George Clinton Esq.</p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Ludington, meanwhile, was busy elsewhere,
in another department of his public duties, of
which we shall speak hereafter. At first commissioned
to serve in Westchester County, then ordered
to the Highlands, he seems to have been permitted to
remain in Westchester and lower Dutchess counties,
where some strong hand was sorely needed. But on
September 15 came news of the battle of the Brandywine,
in which the Stars and Stripes was first unfurled
in battle, but in which the Americans were defeated.
The news was ominous of the fall of Philadelphia
and of the martyrdom of Valley Forge, and
it caused some consternation along the Hudson.
Clinton at once ordered eleven New York militia
regiments to reinforce the Highlands, among them
Colonel Ludington’s, which was to proceed at once to
Peekskill to serve under General Putnam. For the
first time Ludington seems to have had some difficulty
in complying with orders, for, on September
29, we find Clinton writing to him, as well as to the
other colonels of militia, expressing surprise at the
circumstance that, although he had ordered the whole
of the regiments to reinforce the garrisons, not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
than 300 men of six regiments had responded; and
adding a peremptory command that one half of
each regiment should go into service immediately
for one month, and then be relieved by the other half.</p>

<p>There was indeed cause for these preparations, for
the British were at last actually beginning their advance
up the Hudson in aid of the hard-pressed
Burgoyne, though all too late to save him. At the
beginning of October the British fleet appeared in
the Hudson, and on October 4 a landing was made
at Tarrytown. Of what occurred there, we have two
contemporary accounts. One was given in the New
York “Journal” of May 11, 1778, by one of the garrison
of Fort Montgomery, which, as we shall see,
was presently captured by the British. “On Saturday
night,” says that narrator, “we had advice that a
large number of ships, brigs, armed vessels, &amp;c., had
arrived at Tarrytown, where they had landed a considerable
body of men, supposed to be about one
thousand, and had advanced toward the plains. Colonel
Lutlington being posted there with about five
hundred militia, they sent in a flag to him requiring
him to lay down his arms and surrender himself and
men prisoners of war. Whilst he was parleying with
the flag they endeavored to surround him, which he
perceiving ordered his men to retreat. The British
then returned to their shipping, and the next morning
we had advice of their being under sail, and coming
up as far as King’s Ferry.” The “Colonel Lutlington”
referred to was, of course, Henry Ludington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
By “the plains” it is to be supposed White
Plains was meant, that village being distant from
Tarrytown about seven miles.</p>

<p>The second account, much more circumstantial
and authoritative, is that of Colonel Ludington himself
in his report to General Putnam. He was at
that time stationed at Wright’s Mills, between Tarrytown
and White Plains, guarding the inhabitants
from the depredations of Tory and Indian marauders.
He wrote to General Putnam as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sir. I must acquaint you of my yousage in

inclosed his answer to me. You must not depend
too much upon my little party, if I am to gard

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Honoured Sir: in haste I am to acquaint you
that they came up Last night with 2 frigets and
five or six Royale and tenders and about 40 flat
Bottommed boats and landed about 3 thousand
men under the command of governor Tryon.
They immediately took the heights above Tarrytown
and from thence kept the Heights until they
thought they had got above our party. But
Luckily we had got above them and paused at
mr Youngses where we thought Best to move
towards them where we were in open view of
them and found them vastly superior to us in
numbers and moved off to Rights mills, Having
no asistance more than our Little party belonging
to our Regiment. I found on our Retreat
before we got back to Youngses they had sent
forward a flag, But found that was in view of
trapping us as they had flanking parties who we
discovered in order to surround us. But after
clearing the Regiment I rode Back and met the
flag within a quarter of a mile of their main body.
The purport of his errand was that governor
Tryon Had sent him to acquaint me that if we
would give up our arms and submit they would
show us mersy or otherways they were determined
to take us and strip the contre (country).
Sent in answer that as Long as we had a man
alive I was determined to oppose them and they
might come on as soon as they pleased. We have
not lost a man and the last move of the enemy
was from Youngses towards the plains.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>This report is unquestionably authentic, although
the “P. S.” has no address, date nor signature, and
is on a separate sheet of paper from the letter and
the “N. B.” But it is in Henry Ludington’s handwriting,
precisely the same as the signed letter, and
is on precisely the same kind of paper. Doubtless,
then, the “P. S.” was hurriedly written after the letter,
the British attack having occurred between the
two writings, and was enclosed with the letter without
taking time to sign it in any way. The MSS.
were in the possession of the late Douglas Putnam,
of Harmar, Ohio, a great-grandson of General Putnam,
and were left by him to his daughter, Mrs.
Francke H. Bosworth, of New York. It is interesting
to observe that it was with his old chief, Tryon,
that Ludington had on this occasion to deal again.
He estimates the number of the British three times
as high as does the other and less authoritative chronicler,
and is probably more nearly correct. It may
be assumed that the former statement that he had
“about five hundred militia” was much exaggerated.
His own official report of the day before shows his
entire force at Wright’s Mills to have comprised
“One Colonel, 1 Lt. Colonel, 5 Captains, 10 Leutennants,
no Ensign, no Chaplain, 1 Adjutant, 1 Quartermaster,
1 Surgeon, no Surgeons mate, 19 Sergeants,
9 Drummers and Fifers, 182 present fit for
duty, 19 sick present, 3 Sick Absent, 19 on command,
10 on Furlough, Total 233.” With such a
mere handful, he certainly acquitted himself most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
creditably against the vastly superior force of
Tryon.</p>

<p>Putnam was at Peekskill for the express purpose
of guarding the passage up the river. He had there
about 600 regulars and a much larger number of
militia. Governor George Clinton was at Fort
Montgomery, and his brother James Clinton at Fort
Clinton, with combined forces variously reported at
from 600 to 1200 men, mostly militia. Putnam had
scout boats along the river, and an elaborate system
of scouts on land. Yet, says General De Peyster,
“the British Clinton … took advantage of a
fog, transferred his troops over to the western side of
the river, to Stony Point, made a wonderful march
across or rather around the Dunderberg Mountain,
and carried Forts Clinton and Montgomery by assault,
performing the most brilliant British operation
during the seven years’ war.” George Clinton suffered
heavy losses in troops, and narrowly escaped
capture; the State capital, Kingston, was exposed
to the enemy’s advance; and Putnam retired to the
mountains, sending word to Gates that he must prepare
for the worst as he could not prevent the enemy
from advancing up the river to the aid of Burgoyne.
“The enemy can go to Albany with great expedition
and without any opposition.” In the presence of this
disaster two things were uncommonly fortunate for
the American cause. One was that Gates was not
alone in the north, but had Arnold, Schuyler, and
Morgan with him to brace him up. The other was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the British did not attempt to go on up to Albany.
After garrisoning Fort Montgomery, Sir Henry
Clinton returned to New York. On October 15, he
sent an expedition, under General Vaughan, up to
Kingston, and the next day burned that village, the
State government having previously fled to Poughkeepsie.
Other ravages, of looting and burning,
were committed along the river, to the disgrace of the
British arms. But there was some consolation to the
stricken patriots in the news that the very day after
the burning of Kingston, Burgoyne, beaten by Arnold,
Schuyler, and Morgan, surrendered to Gates
with all his army.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1777-78 Colonel Ludington
was chiefly busied with other features of his public
duties, and appeared little in the field. He was a
valuable adviser to the State government on military
affairs, and, realizing from experience the great difficulty
of maintaining a satisfactory militia service in
time of actual warfare, urged the formation of another
regiment of regulars. On December 18, Governor
Clinton referred to this project in a letter to
General Putnam. He urged the necessity of
strengthening the defenses of the Hudson River, and
said that he expected the Committee of Safety at
Poughkeepsie in a few days. He would then lay before
them the proposal for a new regiment of regulars
and added, “I should be glad to have Colo. Ludington’s
Plan.” That winter, the winter of Valley
Forge, was a hard one in which to raise recruits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
any kind, especially in view of the fact that the troops
had received no pay for their services for a long time
past. Colonel Ludington felt this keenly, and on
being asked by Clinton to furnish a certain number
of men from his regiment for the new regiment of
regulars, he wrote very frankly on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Honoured Sir, I am under the Disagrable
Nesesity of acqainting you, that I find it to Be
out of my power to Comply with your Orders in
Regard of Raising the Coto (Quota) of men
aloted me to Raise out of my Regiment, and that
for Sundry Reasons. In the first place, the
money Raised in the other Regments By their
asesments amounts to one Hundread pounds
Bounty to Each Soldier By Reason of the Exempts
Being able and among whom are a number
of Quakers. But it is not the Case in my Regment,
For, By the Best Computation we Can
make, we Cannot Raise more than 30 Dolars a
man, though I would not Be understood that we
have gone through with the asesments and that
for this Reason: the act for asesing the Exempts
Expresly says that the officers who aseses the
Exempts Shall Be Freeholders, and I have not
Such an officer in my Regiment. We have met
Sundry times in order to try to Raise the men
and I yoused my Best Endevours that they
Should Be Raised, But I have not an officer that
will asist the Exempts. The officers tell me they
posatively will not Call their Companies out until
they get pay for their Past Servises in order to
avoid Service; on that account I have had their
pay roles maid up in time and Signed By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
general, and Have weighted on the pay master for
the money Everry few Days, and yesterday for
the Last time, and He then told He had no prospect
in geting the money in Sum months. That
Being the Case I am Sory I must Tell your Honour
that I know not what further measures to
take until I have Sum further instructions in Regard
of the matter. It is my opinion that we
Shall never Raise the men, unles the State asists
us in Raising a part of the Bounty and the Soldiers
gets their wages for their past Servises.
Sir, a few lines from your Honour in Regard of
the above, By way of instructions, will mutch oblige
your Humble Servant,</p>

<p class="noindent">To His Excelency George Clinton Esqr. Governor.</p>

<p>P. S. Sir, if there Be a late act past in Regard

<p>Colonel Ludington and his regiment were again
called to the defense of the Hudson at Fishkill in
June, 1779, on the alarm caused by the British
seizure of Verplanck’s Point, and a few days later
returned to the vicinity of Crom Pond to resume the
local police work which formed so large a part of
their duties. There, before daylight of June 24, they
were surprised by an attack of about two hundred
British cavalry, which had made a dash all the way
up from New York. Nearly thirty of the militia
were killed and wounded in the sharp skirmish which
ensued. At the same time 130 British light infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
came across from Verplanck’s Point and made a demonstration
in aid of the cavalry. On another occasion
a similar attack was made while the Americans
were at breakfast, close by the church, which at the
time was used as an arsenal.</p>

<p>After these services the regiment was marched
home to Fredericksburgh and for a time disbanded.
On this occasion Colonel Ludington wrote to Clinton
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thereafter Colonel Ludington and his regiment
were frequently engaged in important work, especially
during the time of doubt and dread caused by
the treason of Arnold, and in the operations preliminary
to Washington’s epoch-making march from
the Hudson to the Chesapeake. But those services
belonged to the other phases of public duty to which
reference has been made and of which fuller consideration
must be reserved for another chapter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">SECRET SERVICE</span></h2>

<p>Another part of Henry Ludington’s services
to his country during the Revolution was intimately
connected with that little known underworld
of the Secret Service—the men who take their
lives in their hands perhaps more perilously than the
soldier in the open field, who have no stimulus of
martial glory, who receive no public recognition, and
whose very names are doomed to obscurity. A recent
work of fiction, one of the best “historical novels” of
our day—“The Reckoning,” by Mr. Robert W.
Chambers—gives a singularly dramatic and convincing
picture of the work of a Patriot spy in New
York City in the Revolution, doing work which was
hateful to him and yet which was of the highest importance
to Washington himself. It is a picture as
true as it is graphic. An earlier work dealing with
the same phase of Patriot service, “The Spy,” of
Fenimore Cooper, has long been familiar to the
American public, and it has generally been assumed
that its hero, “Harvey Birch,” was an actual character,
drawn from life; even more closely than the
genius of “The Pilot” was drawn from the illustrious
Paul Jones. Such indeed was the case, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
original of “Harvey Birch,” Enoch Crosby, Colonel
Ludington was intimately associated. Indeed, because
of his familiarity with the borderland between
the British and American lines, and also because of
his knowledge and judgment of men, his discretion,
and his known trustworthiness, Colonel Ludington
was selected, by Washington’s instructions, to choose
the man or men who should do the secret service of
the Patriot cause within the British lines at New
York, and to make the needed arrangements for his
dispatch and for maintaining communication with
him.</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly we find Nathaniel Sackett, of whom
mention has already been made, addressing to Colonel
Ludington this significant letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Sir</p>

<p>you will proceed on inquiring for a proper person

of your own unless you find one that in your opinion
and skill is possessed of abilitys to carry a
secret matter into Execution. upon your finding
such a Person and his consenting to Remove into
the city you will then desire him to come with you
immediately to me, and you will enjoin secrecy
upon and direct him not to mention either his

<p class="noindent">To Colonel Henry Ludington Esqr.</p>

</div>

<p>The purport of this was unmistakable. Colonel
Ludington was to find some one to serve as a spy in
New York, and he was to do it with such prudence
and tact that nobody but himself would seem responsible
for the negotiations until they had proceeded
far enough to give assurance of the fitness
and trustworthiness of the man selected for the
work. Colonel Ludington proceeded promptly
with the undertaking, and with commendable caution,
as the following document shows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I do most solemnly swear by Almighty God
Who Liveth forever and ever that I will well
and Truly keep every matter and thing Committed
to my Charge by Henry Ludington Esqr
a profound secret, and that I will not Directly or
indirectly either by words or actions signs or
Tokens or by any other ways or means whatever
disclose or divulge the same to any manner of
Person or Persons whatever.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Benajah Tubbs was a well-approved military
comrade of Colonel Ludington’s, as appears from
the records. In the Correspondence of the Provincial
Congress of New York there appears a communication
from the Dutchess County Committee of
Safety, under date of January 3, 1776, recommending
Benajah Tubbs to be adjutant of “the regiment
of militia lately commanded by Beverly Robinson,
Esq.,” together with Henry Ludington as 2nd
major and John Kaine as colonel. The extent of
Tubbs’s services as a secret agent of the Revolutionary
government does not appear, nor is it at this time
possible to ascertain how many and what other men
were selected by Colonel Ludington for such perilous
errands. The career of Enoch Crosby is, however,
a matter of specific and exact record. It is to
be found related not only in the fascinating pages of
Cooper, but also in various affidavits made by Crosby
himself, and others who knew him, at the time of his
application for a pension for his services. These
papers, which have been transcribed from the originals
by Mr. Patrick, are in chief as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">State of N. Y.<br />
Co. Putnam. ss.</p>

<p>On this 15th day of October in the year 1832
personally appeared before the Court of Oyer
and Terminer and General Jail Delivery of the
said County of Putnam, Enoch Crosby, of the
town of South East in the Co. of Putnam and
State of New York, aged 82 years, who being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
duly sworn according to law doth on his oath
make the following declaration in order to obtain
the benefit of the Act of Congress passed
June 7, 1832:</p>

<p>That he entered the service of the U. S. under
the following named officers and served as herein
stated:</p>

<p>That in the month of April or the fore part of
May, 1775, he enlisted in the town of Danbury
in the State of Connecticut into Captain Noble
Benedict’s Co. in Col. Waterbury’s Regt. of
troops to defend the country for 8 mos service.
The regiment met at Greenwich in Ct., staid
there two or three months, then went to N. Y.
under Genl. Wooster. Staid in N. Y. a few
weeks. The Regt. was then carried to Albany in
sloops &amp; went directly to Half Moon, was there
a few days. Went thence to Ticonderoga,
where the batteauxs furnished which were to convey
them further. Genl. Schuyler had the command
of the Isle aux Nois, when Genl. S. being
unwell, Genl. Montgomery had the command.
The declarant went off to St. John which being
by us at time besieged by the Americans in about
5 weeks surrendered and the fort was taken. The
decl. then went to Montreal, that he came from
there with Col. Waterbury’s regt to Albany,
and having served the eight mos. was at that
place (Albany) permitted to leave the regt. and
return home, and that he had no written discharge.
And this dec. further says that in the
latter part of the mo. of Aug., 1776, he enlisted
into the regt. commanded by Col. Swartwout
in Fredericksburgh, now Kent, in the County of
Putnam and started to join the army at Kingsbridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
The co. had left F. before declarant
started &amp; he started alone after his said enlistment
&amp; on his way at a place in Westchester Co.
about 2 miles from Pine’s Bridge he fell in company
with a stranger who accosted him &amp; asked
him if he was going <i>down</i>. Decl. replied he
was. The stranger then asked if decl. was not
afraid to venture alone, and said there were
many rebels below and he would meet with difficulty
in getting down. The decl. perceived from
the observation of the stranger that he supposed
the decl. intended to go to the British, and willing
to encourage that misapprehension and turn
it to the best advantage he asked if there was any
mode which he the stranger could point out by
which the decl. could get through safely. The
stranger being satisfied the decl. was willing to
join the British Army told him that there was a
company raising in that county to join the British
Army, that was nearly completed and in a
few days would be ready to go down and that
dec. had better join that co. and go down with
them. The stranger finally gave to decl. his
name, it was Bunker, and told the decl. where
and shewed the house in which he lived and also
told him that ⸺ Fowler was to be the Captain
of the Co. then raising, and ⸺ Kipp Lieut.
After having learned this much from Bunker
the Decl. told him he was unwilling to wait until
the Co. could be ready to march and would try
and get through, and parted from him on his way
down and continued until night, when he stopped
at the house of a man who was called Esy Young,
and put up there for the night. In the course of
conversation with Esy Young in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
decl. learned that he was a member of the Com.
of Safety for the County of Westchester, and then
communicated to him the information he had obtained
from Mr. Bunker. Esy Young requested
the decl. to accompany him the next morning to
the White Plains in Westchester Co. as the Com.
of Safety for the Co. were on that day to meet at
the Court House in that place. The next morning
the decl. in company with Esy Young went to
the White Plains and found the Com. there sitting.
After Esy Young had had an interview
with the Com. the decl. was sent for and went before
the Com. then sitting in the Court Room
and there communicated the information he had
obtained from Bunker. The Com. after learning
the situation of decl. that he was a soldier enlisted
in Col. Swartwout’s regiment and on his way to
join it engaged to write to the Col. and explain
why he did not join it, if he would consent to aid
in the apprehension of the company then raising.
It was by all thought best that he should not join
the regiment but should act in a different character,
as he could thus be more useful to his country.
He was accordingly announced to Capt.
Townsend, who was then at the White Plains
commanding a company of Rangers, as a prisoner
and the Captain was directed to keep him
until further orders.</p>

<p>In the evening after he was placed as a prisoner
by Capt. Townsend he made an excuse to go
out and was accompanied by a soldier, over a
fence into a piece of corn then nearly or quite full
grown. As soon as he was out of sight of the
soldier he made the best of his way from the soldier
and when the soldier hailed him to return he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was almost beyond hearing. An alarm gun was
fired but decl. was far from danger. In the
course of the night the decl. reached the house of
the said Bunker, who got up and let him in.
Decl. then related to Bunker the circumstances
of his having been taken prisoner, of his going
before the Com. at the Court House, of being
put under the charge of Capt. Townsend, and of
his escape; that he had concluded to avail himself
of the protection of the Co. raising in his neighborhood
to get down. The next morning Bunker
went with decl. and introduced him as a good
loyalist to several of the Co. Decl. remained
some days with different individuals of the Co.
and until it was about to go down, when the decl.
went one night to the house of Esy Young to
give information of the state and progress of the
Co. The distance was four or five miles from
Bunker’s. At the house of Esy Young decl.
found Capt. Townsend with a great part of his
Co., and after giving the information he returned
to the neighborhood of Bunker, and that night
decl. with a great part of the Co. which was proposing
to go down were made prisoners. The
next day all of them, about 30 in numbers, were
marched to the White Plains and remained there
several days, a part of the time locked up in jail
with the other prisoners. The residue of the time
he was with the Com. The prisoners were finally
ordered to Fishkill in the Co. of Dutchess, where
the State Convention was then sitting. The decl.
went as a prisoner to Fishkill. Capt. Townsend
with his Co. of Rangers took charge of the Co. at
Fishkill. A Com. for Detecting Conspiracies
was sitting, composed of John Jay, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Gov. of N. Y., Zephaniah Platt, afterwards first
Judge of Dutchess Co., Col. Duer of the Co. of
Albany, and a Mr. Sackett. The decl. was called
before that Com., who understood the character
of the decl. and the nature of his services. This
the Com. must have learned either from Capt.
Townsend or from the Com. at White Plains.
The decl. was examined under oath and his examination
reduced to writing. The prisoners
with decl. were kept whilst decl. remained at
Fishkill in a building which had been occupied as
a Hatter’s shop, and they were guarded by a Co.
of Rangers commanded by Capt. Clark. The
decl. remained about a week at Fishkill, when he
was bailed by Jonathan Hopkins. This was done
to cover the character in which the decl. acted.
Before the decl. was bailed the Fishkill Com. had
requested him to continue in this service, and on
decl. mentioning the fact of his having enlisted
in Col. Swartwout’s company and the necessity
there was of his joining it, he was informed that
he should be indemnified from that enlistment,
that they would write to the Col. and inform him
that decl. was in their service.</p>

<p>The Com. then wished decl. to undertake a
secret service over the river. He was furnished
with a secret pass which was accordingly signed
by the Com., which is now lost, and directed to go
to the house of Nicholas Brauns, near the mouth
of the Wappinger’s Creek, who would take him
across the river, and there to proceed to the house
of John Russell, about ten miles from the river,
and make such inquiries and discoveries as he
could. He proceeded according to directions to
said Brauns and from thence to John Russell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and there hired himself to said Russell to work
for him, but for no definite time. This was a
neighborhood of Loyalists and it was expected
that a company was there raising but was not
completed. Before decl. left Russell on this service
a time was fixed for him to recross the river
and give information to some one of the Com.
who was to meet him. This time having arrived
and the Co. not being completed the decl. recrossed
the river and met Zephaniah Platt, one of
the Com., and gave him all the information he
had obtained. Decl. was directed to recross the
river to the neighborhood of Russell and on a
time fixed again to meet the Com. on the east side
of the river. Decl. returned to Russell’s neighborhood,
soon became intimate with the Loyalists,
was introduced to Capt. Robinson, said to be
an English officer and who was to command the
Co. then raising. Capt. Robinson occupied a
cave in the mountains, and decl. having agreed
to go with the Co. was invited and accepted of the
invitation to lodge with Robinson in the cave.
They slept together nearly a week in the cave,
and the time for the Co. to start having been
fixed and the route designated to pass Severn’s
to Bush Carrick’s, where they were to stop the
first night. The time for starting having arrived
before the appointed time to meet the Com. on the
east side of the river, the decl. in order to get an
opportunity to convey information to Fishkill
recommended that each man should the night before
they started sleep where he chose, and that
each should be by himself, for if they should be
discovered that night together all would be taken,
which would be avoided if they were separated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
The proposition was acceded to, and when they
separated decl. not having time to go to Fishkill,
and as the only and as it appeared the best means
of giving information was to go to Mr. Purdy,
who was a stranger to decl. and all he knew of
him was that the Tories called him a wicked rebel
and said he ought to die. Decl. went and found
said Purdy and informed him of the situation of
affairs, of the time the Co. was to start, and the
place which they were to stop the first night, and
requested him to go to Fishkill and give the information
to the Com. Purdy assured the decl.
that the information should be given. Decl. returned
to Russell’s and lodged in his house. The
following evening the Co. assembled, consisting
about 30 men, and started from Russell’s house,
which was in the town of Marlborough, County
of Ulster, for N. Y., and in the course of the
night arrived at Bush Carrick’s, and went into
the barn to lodge after taking refreshments. Before
morning the barn was surrounded by American
troops, and the whole company, including
Capt. Robinson, were made prisoners. The
troops who took the company prisoners were commanded
by Capt. Melancthon Smith, who commanded
a company of Rangers at Fishkill. His
Co. crossed the river to perform this service. Col.
Duer was with Capt. Smith’s Co. on this expedition.
The prisoners including decl. were marched
to Fishkill &amp; confined in the stone church, in
which there was near two hundred prisoners.
After remaining one night in the church the Com.
sent for decl. and told him it was unsafe for him
to remain with the prisoners as the least suspicion
of the course he had pursued would be fatal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
him, and advised him to leave the village of Fishkill
and to remain where they could call on him if
his services should be wanted. Decl. went to the
house of a Dutchman, a farmer, whose name is
forgotten, about five miles from the village of
Fishkill, and there went to work making shoes.
After decl. had made arrangements for working
at shoes, he informed Mr. Sackett, one of the
Com., where he could be found if he should be
wanted. In about a week decl. recd. a letter from
the Com., requesting him to meet one of the Com.
at the house of Dr. Osborn, about one mile from
Fishkill. Decl. according to the request went to
the house of Dr. Osborn, and soon after John Jay
came there, enquired for the Dr., who was absent,
enquired for medicine, but found none he wanted.
He came out of the house and went to his horse,
near which decl. stood, and as he passed he said
in a low voice “It won’t do, there are too many
around. Return to your work.” Decl. went back
and went to work at shoes, but within a day or
two was again notified and a horse sent to him,
requiring him to go to Bennington in Vt. and
from there westerly to a place called Maloonscock,
and there call on Hazard Wilcox, a Tory
of much notoriety, and ascertain if anything was
going on there injurious to the common cause.
Decl. followed his instructions, found Wilcox,
but could not learn that any secret measure was
then projected against the interest of the country.
At that place learned from Wilcox a list of
persons friendly to the British cause, who could
be safely trusted, from that place quite down to
the south part of Dutchess County. Decl. followed
directions of said Wilcox and called on different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
individuals by him mentioned, but could
discover nothing of importance, until he reached
the town of Pawlings in Dutchess County, where
he called upon a Dr. whose name he thinks was
Prosser, and informed him that he wished to go
below but was fearful of some trouble. The Dr.
informed him there was a Co. raising in that
vicinity to go to N. Y. to join the British army,
that the Captain’s name was Sheldon, that he had
been down and got a commission, that he, Prosser,
was doctoring the Lieut., whose name was
Chase, that if decl. would wait a few days he
could safely go down with that Co., that he could
stay about the neighborhood and should be informed
when the Co. was ready, that decl. remained
in that vicinity, became acquainted with
several of the persons who were going with that
Co., was acquainted with Lieut. Chase, but never
saw the Capt. to form any acquaintance with him.
The season had got so far advanced that the Co.
was about to start to join the enemy to be ready
for an early campaign in 1777. It was about the
last of Feb. of that year when a plan was fixed
and also a time for meeting. It was situated half
a mile from the road and about 3 miles from a
house then occupied by Col. Morehouse, a militia
Col. After the time was fixed for the meeting of
Capt. Sheldon’s Co., the deponent went in the
night to Col. Morehouse &amp; informed him of the
situation, of the Co., of the time appointed for
meeting, of the place, etc., and Morehouse informed
decl. that they should be attended to.
The decl. remained almost one month in this
neighborhood, and once in the time met Mr.
Sackett, one of the Com., at Col. Ludington’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and apprised him what was going on, and was to
have given the Com. intelligence when the Co.
was to march, but the shortness of the time between
the final arrangement and the time of starting
was such that decl. was obliged to give the information
to Col. Morehouse. The Co., consisting
of about 30, met at the time and place appointed,
and after they had been there an hour
or two two young men of the Co. came in &amp; said
there was a gathering under arms at Old Morehouse’s.
The inquiry became general, What
could it mean? Was there any traitor in the
Company? The Captain soon called one or two
of the Company out of the door for the purpose
of private conversation about the situation, &amp;
very soon decl. heard the cry “Stand! Stand!”
Those out the door ran, but were soon met by a
Co. coming from a different direction, they were
taken, the house surrounded &amp; the Co. all made
prisoners. The Col. then ordered them to be tied
together two by two. They came to decl. and he
urged to be excused from going as he was lame
and could not travel. The Col. replied “You
shall go, dead or alive, &amp; if no other way you shall
be carried on the horse with me.” The rest were
marched off &amp; decl. put onto the horse with Col.
Morehouse and when the prisoners were marched
into the house the decl. with the permission of
Morehouse left them and made the best of his
way to Col. Ludington’s and there informed him
about daylight in the morning. From thence he
went to Fishkill to the house of Dr. Van Wyck
where John Jay boarded, and there informed him
of all the occurrences on that northern expedition.
Said Jay requested decl. to come before the Com.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the next night, when they would be ready to receive
him. He accordingly went before the Com.,
where he declared under oath all that had occurred
since he had seen them. The Com. then
directed him to go to the house of Col. Van Ness
in Albany County, and there take directions from
him. He went to Van Ness’s house and was directed
by him to go north, but decl. cannot tell
the place. The duty was performed, but nothing
material discovered further than that the confiscation
of the personal property of the Tories and
leasing of their lands had a great tendency to discourage
them from joining the British army.
Decl. then returned to Po’keepsie, where Egbert
Benson and Melancthon Smith entered in the
room of the Fishkill Com. There was no more
business in that town in which they wished to employ
decl., and he being apprehensive that a
longer continuance in that employment would be
dangerous &amp; the time for which he enlisted in Col.
Swartwout’s regiment having expired, he came
home with the approbation of the Com.</p>

<p>This was about the last of May, 1777, and in
the course of the fall, after decl. saw Col. Swartwout
at his house in Fishkill &amp; then talked over
the subject of this employment of the decl. by the
Com. &amp; the Col. told decl. that he had drawn his
pay the same as if he had been with the Reg’t,
that the Paymaster of the Reg’t lived in the town
of Hurley in Ulster Co. Decl. went to the Paymaster
and rec’d his pay for nine months’ service
or for the term for which the regiment was raised.
The decl. was employed in the secret service for a
period of full 9 months.</p>

<p>This decl. further says that in the year 1779 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the month of May he enlisted in a company commanded
by Captain Jonah Hallett for six
months. Decl. enlisted as a Sergeant in said
Hallett’s Co. The term of enlistment was performed
on the lines in the Co. of Westchester,
moving from place to place to guard the country
and to detect Tories; that the Co. continued in
this service until after Stony Point was taken by
Genl. Wayne &amp; abandoned &amp; also reoccupied &amp;
abandoned by the English troops, when the Co.
was ordered over the river &amp; joined the regiment
at Stony Point and continued there in making
preparations for building a block house until the
time of the expiration of the service, when the Co.
was ordered to march to Po’keepsie to be discharged
by the Governor. When they arrived the
Governor was absent, the Co. was billetted out &amp;
decl. was billetted upon the family of Dr. Tappen.
After remaining a day or two and the Governor
not arriving they were discharged. During
this service in Westchester Co. the following occurrence
took place: A British vessel lay at anchor
near Tiller’s Point &amp; a party of sailors &amp;
marines came on shore &amp; marched a short distance
from the water, where a party of our men got
between them &amp; the water &amp; made them prisoners.
They were marched to the place where the
Co. lay a little east of Tiller’s Point. The number
of prisoners decl. thinks was 12 and the captors
6. The prisoners were afterward sent to
Po’keepsie.</p>

<p>The decl. further says that in the month of
May in the year 1780 he again enlisted for 6
months in a Co. commanded by Capt. Ludington
in Col. Benschoten’s Regt. He entered as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Sergeant in the town of Fredericksburgh, now
the town of Kent, Putnam Co. The Regt. assembled
at Fishkill &amp; marched to West Point &amp;
remained there a few days, some 10 or 15. A call
was made for troops to fill up the Brigade or
Brigades under the command of General De La
Fayette and they were to be raised by drafts or
volunteers. A call was made for volunteers and
decl. with others volunteered &amp; made a Co. which
was put under Capt. Daniel Delavan. The decl.
continued to be a Sergeant in Delavan’s Co. Col.
Philip Van Courtland commanded the Regt. to
which Capt. Delavan’s Co. was attached. Soon
after the Co. was formed they crossed the river
from West Point and marched to Peekskill,
where they remained one night, the next day
marched to Verplanck’s Point and crossed over
to Stony Point, &amp; from thence made the best of
their way to New Jersey where they remained
until late in the fall, when the time of enlistment
having expired they were discharged, after having
fully and faithfully performed the service of
6 months for which he enlisted. During the campaign
in New Jersey Major André was arrested,
condemned &amp; executed. Several of the soldiers
of Capt. Delavan’s Co. went to see him executed.
The decl. was Sergeant of the guard that day &amp;
could not go to see the execution.</p>

<p>The decl. further says that he has no documentary
evidence of his service and that he knows of
no person who can testify to his services other
than those whose depositions are hereto annexed.
The decl. hereby relinquishes every claim to a
pension or annuity except the present &amp; declares
that his name is not on the pension roll agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of any State. The decl. was born in a place called
Harwich in the County of Barnstable and State
of Mass. in the year 1750. The decl. has a record
of his age. The decl. was living in the town of
Danbury in the State of Conn when he enlisted in
the service, that service the Revolutionary War.
The decl. has resided in the State of New York
in what is now the Co. of Putnam, formerly Co.
of Dutchess, &amp; now lives in the same Co. &amp; on the
same farm where he has lived for the last 50 years.
The decl. always volunteered in every enlistment
&amp; to perform all the service which he performed
as detailed in this declaration. That the decl. was
acquainted with the following officers who were
with the troops where he served: Genl. Schuyler,
Gen. Montgomery, Gen. Wooster, Col. Waterbury,
Col. Holmes, Gen. De La Fayette, Gen.
Poor, Col. Van Courtland, Col. Benschoten, Col.
Ludington. The decl. never rec’d. any written
discharge &amp; if he ever received a Sergeant’s warrant
it is through time or accident lost or destroyed.
This decl. is known to Samuel Washburn,
a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of
the Co. of Putnam; Beneah Y. Morse, a clergyman
in his neighborhood and who he believes can
testify to his character for veracity &amp; good behavior
&amp; thus belief of his services as a Soldier of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Appended to this declaration were affidavits of
Judge Washburn and the Rev. Mr. Morse, confirming
so far as their knowledge extended the statements
of Enoch Crosby. There were also similar
affidavits of Timothy Wood, Jabez Berry, and
Daniel Crawford, who had been fellow soldiers with
Crosby in the war.</p>

<p>Enough has been said already to indicate the intimate
relations which existed between Crosby and
Colonel Ludington. While the spy was on service
in Dutchess County, in connection with Prosser and
his company, he was a frequent visitor at Ludington’s
house, and often lay hidden securely there
while Tories were searching for him. (Between
Prosser and Colonel Ludington, by the way, as we
shall presently see, a peculiarly bitter personal feud
existed.) Colonel Ludington’s daughters, Sibyl and
Rebecca, were also privy to Crosby’s doings, and had
a code of signals, by means of which they frequently
admitted him in secrecy and safety to the house,
where he was fed and lodged. In addition to Crosby
and to Benajah Tubbs, who was mentioned at the
beginning of this chapter, Colonel Ludington furnished
numerous other members of the Secret Service
from the ranks of his own regiment, and was himself
the recipient of their clandestine reports, some of
which were transmitted by him to the Committee of
Safety and some to the headquarters of General
Washington.</p>

<span class="smaller">BETWEEN THE LINES</span></h2>

<p>“Between the lines” is always a place of peculiar
difficulty and danger. The Border States
in our Civil War were the deadliest battle-grounds,
not only the meeting-places of the contending armies
but also the scene of innumerable local feuds and
conflicts between the inhabitants, half of whom inclined
to one side and half to the other. A similar
position was held in the Revolution by Westchester
and Dutchess counties, lying between the British at
the south and the Americans at the north. As this
was the most fertile and productive agricultural
region easily accessible from New York, it was frequently
invaded by British foraging parties, seeking
the supplies which were needed by the army in
the city and which were not easily to be got elsewhere.
Nor did the region altogether escape similar
attentions from the American Army. More than
once, indeed, organized raids were made by the latter
southward into the part of the debatable ground
lying nearest to the British lines, not only to secure
forage and other supplies for American use but also
to prevent them from falling into the hands of the
British. Himself a resident of that region, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Ludington was well fitted to deal with such local
conditions, and accordingly a large third part of his
public services were thus rendered. Entries in his
ledger indicate that he was a member of the Dutchess
County Committee of Safety on June 11, 1776,
and for some time thereafter. This was the committee
which was constituted for the purpose of “inquiring
into, detecting and defeating all conspiracies
formed in this State against the liberties of America.”
When he was no longer a member of the committee
he was one of its most efficient executive
agents, and much of the services of himself and his
regiment were given in pursuance of the plans of
that committee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus18">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="650" height="440" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Home of the late Frederick Ludington, son of Colonel Ludington, at Kent</p>
</div>

<p>In the records of the Committee of Safety under
date of October 14, 1776, we find that “Col. Ludington
informed a member that he has 20 or more Arms,
taken from disaffected persons, now in his possession,
and requests to know how they shall be disposed of.
Ordered, That Col. Ludington send all arms in his
possession, taken from disaffected persons, to this
Committee without delay, and that he sends his account
for repairing to the Auditor-General.” The
“account for repairing” refers to the work done by
Colonel Ludington on the captured weapons to
make them serviceable for use in the American
Army; many of the Tories deliberately breaking
their muskets or depriving them of essential parts,
before surrendering them. A little later William
Duer, one of the foremost members of the Committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
reported that “large quantities of hay and corn
were purchased by the Quarter Master General for
use of the Continental Army in the eastern part of
this (Dutchess) County and the western part of
Connecticut, that it would be hardly practicable to
convey the same to the army unless the roads leading
from the Oblong and Fredericksburgh towards
Pine’s Bridge and North Castle were better repaired.
He therefore in behalf of General Mifflin, Quarter
Master General of the Continental Army, prayed
that this House would devise ways and means of
facilitating the above mentioned communication, not
doubting but so necessary an expenditure would be
cheerfully reimbursed from the Continental Treasury.
On taking the application of Mr. Duer into
consideration, Resolved, That it will be necessary to
repair the following Roads in order to facilitate the
cartage of forage to the Continental Army, from the
house of Col. Henry Ludington thence to Samuel
Washburn’s, being 8 miles; the road which runs east
from Col. Harry Ludington’s to the Store of Malcolm
Morrison’s and thence south to the Mills of
Samuel Washburn, being 12 miles. Resolved That
Col. Ludington detach from his Regiment 100 men
for the purpose of repairing that part of the road
which is first mentioned, being in distance 8 Miles.…
Ordered, that copies of these Resolutions be
immediately transmitted to the Supts. above mentioned,
who are directed to communicate them without
loss of time to Cols. Fields and Luddington.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
For this road-mending work the Committee fixed
the price of labor at ten shillings a day, exclusive of
subsistence, for the superintendents, and four shillings
a day for the men, the latter to provide their
own sustenance. They had power to impress teams
and carts, and to pay for each ox-cart and two yoke
of cattle sixteen shillings, and for each wagon twelve
shillings. Those who remember the common condition
of roads in that part of the State a score of years
ago, will appreciate what need there must have been
a century before of repairs and improvements.</p>

<p>The varied character of Colonel Ludington’s services
in the first years of the Revolution is indicated
by the entries in his ledger. Thus in November,
1776, we find him charging the Committee for inquiring
into and detecting conspiracies against the
State of New York with “4 days service riding with
Nathaniel Sackett in order to collect evidence, at 21
shillings, 4 days, £4—5—4.” On November 21,
1776: “Then began the service of buying hay and
grain for the use of the Continental Army by an
agreement with Wm. Duer.” On January 1, 1777:
“Then stopped the service of buying hay, being in
all 41 days at 20 shillings per day.” In November,
1777: “Then engaged in the Commissary Department
under Deputy Commissary General and continued
on the service until the 8th of January, 48
days in all at 32 shillings per day, 58 £ 16 s.”</p>

<p>A number of persons were arrested and taken before
the Committee at Fishkill in December, 1776,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and on December 20 one of them, David Aikins,
made affidavit: “That on or about the 29th day of
November last, he set out from home with a pass
from Colonel Henry Ludington to go to Horse
Neck to buy rum; and further stated he was disappointed
in getting it. He then proceeded to find
one Barnes Hatfield who owed him a considerable
sum of money, but not finding him he went to see
Isaac Williams who had married his cousin, and
while there he was captured by Rogers’s Rangers
(British) and afterwards was taken before a Major
near King’s Bridge. The Major asked him how he
could clear himself from the rebel pass found upon
him. He said he came down upon a particular errand
from Captain Alexander Grant’s wife to him
and if he would send him to Capt. Grant or Capt.
Archbd. Campbell he would prove his character.
Upon his arrival to Capt. Campbell said he was a
prisoner and it was in his power to discharge him.
Campbell said he would discharge him if he would
carry some papers and errands to certain persons in
his neighborhood and be secret about it. He promised
and Captain Campbell gave him two printed
papers and protections from General Howe for Malcolm
Morrison, John Kain, Alexander Kidd, Matthew
Patterson, Charles Collins and one for himself.”
In an affidavit two days later the Patterson
mentioned declared: “That he told Akins that he did
not chuse to have anything to do with such things,
and further saith that there was a Man in the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
meaning Colo. Luddinton, who if he knew what
Aikins said would immediately send him to Congress,
but did not deem it expedient to mention to
Col. Ludington.”</p>

<p>Malcolm Morrison appears to have been apprehended
on suspicion and to have been held for a
time at Kingston jail, whence he sent, on February
19, 1777, a petition in which he said: “Your petitioner
has always been ready in assisting both officers
and soldiers in their publick business of the States
and in a most generous manner has advanced them
Cash for their Different Reliefs, and is at present a
very considerable sum out of pocket on that account
and has received no part of such sum except six
pounds lent to Colo. Luddleton and Wm. Griffin to
enable them to find out that pernicious plot of John
Miller and Constant Nickerson, Reference being had
to these gentlemen for the truth of his advice &amp; assistance
in bringing that plot to light.” Morrison
took the oath of allegiance and was released. The
Nickerson referred to was doubtless Captain “Josh”
Nickerson, of the Swamp, near Fredericksburgh, a
notorious Tory. He enlisted and drilled a large
number of men, with the design of taking them to
join General Howe’s army in New York. Their
plans and meetings were all supposed to be kept a
profound secret, but Colonel Ludington learned of
them and made counter plans for the capture of the
whole party. To that end he sent one of his tenants
as a spy to ascertain the number, place of meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
etc., of the Tories. This spy, after some difficulty,
fell in with one of the party and pretended to him
that he was desirous of enlisting in the British Army.
He was thereupon taken to Nickerson and enrolled.
He ascertained that a certain night had been appointed
for their setting out for New York, and also
that the roster of the company was kept concealed in
a hollow walking-stick which Nickerson always had
by him. This information was promptly conveyed
to Colonel Ludington, who forthwith assembled his
regiment, surrounded Nickerson and his company on
the night set for their departure for New York, and
took them all prisoners. The documentary evidence
of their guilt was found on the written roll, and
Nickerson was vastly chagrined when Colonel Ludington
bade him give up the cane and then opened it
and took out the hidden paper.</p>

<p>The southern part of Dutchess County, now Putnam
County, was, in fact, one of the most critical
danger spots in the whole country, as a passage in
the Journal of the Convention of the State of New
York shows, under date of Sunday morning, May 4,
1777:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Capt. Delavan, who being called before the
Convention, after giving information upon the
subject contained in the letters brought by him,
further informed the House, That the disaffected
persons are very numerous in the southern parts
of Dutchess County, and that without doubt they
will fall upon the Whigs whenever the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
attack our army at Peekskill or at the forts in the
Highlands; they therefore request the Convention
to take some measure in the premises. Thereupon
Resolved, That Mr. Jay, Colo. Thomas,
Colo. Ludington be Commissioners to prevent,
quell and subdue all insurrections and disaffections
in the Counties of Dutchess and Westchester,
and to take every measure for that purpose
which they shall deem necessary; and that
they cooperate with Messrs. Robert R. Livingston,
Zephaniah Platt and Matthew Cantine, a
committee appointed yesterday, for the like purpose
in the Manor of Livingston and Rhinebeck
Precinct. Resolved, That the said Commissioners
immediately collect with the assistance of General
McDougall, or General George Clinton, or
from the militia of the County of Dutchess,
whichever shall appear to them most expeditious,
a force sufficient for the purpose and also to comply
with the following instructions, to wit: Gentlemen:
You are to begin in the southern part of
the County of Dutchess and proceed to the northward,
and in your progress secure the disaffected,
call out the whole militia, and destroy all such as
shall be found in arms to oppose you. When you
shall meet with the Committee above mentioned
you are to act in concert with them, to secure the
prisoners you shall have respectively made, to
dismiss such of the militia as you may think
proper, and with the remainder march into the
County of Westchester by different ways, concerting
at the same time such measures with General
McDougall or other commanding officer at
Peekskill as will effectually clear said county of
Westchester of all dangerous and disaffected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
persons. You are on every occasion, by every
means in your power (torture excepted) to compel
the discovery and delivery of spies or other
emissaries of the enemy, who you may have
reason to believe are concealed in any part of the
country through which you may make progress
and upon due proof immediately execute them <i>in
terrorem</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>A copy of the resolutions was sent to Livingston,
Platt, and Cantine, with additional instructions to
conform with the resolutions sent them, and after
having cleared the manor of Livingston and the precinct
of Rhinebeck of all dangerous and disaffected
inhabitants, to proceed southward until they met
with Jay, Thomas, and Ludington, conducting
themselves in accordance with the resolutions; and
when they had met with them, immediately to form
a proper plan and endeavor to carry the plan into
immediate execution. Discretion was given to vary
from instructions as the circumstances might require.
Copies of the intelligence received by the
Convention were sent to the commissioners. A few
days later, under date of May 8, Livingston, Platt
and Cantine reported that the number of conspirators
was far greater than they had imagined, almost
everybody in the upper manor, particularly the eastern
part of it, being disaffected, and they urged that
courts martial were absolutely necessary for dealing
with the chief offenders. As for Jay, Thomas, and
Ludington, they entered upon their part of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with zeal, but found themselves somewhat hampered
by other demands made upon them and by the unwillingness
of some of the militia to engage in the
service of the Continental Army. On June 25 this
matter was brought before the Convention, and it
was—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Resolved, That whereas information hath been
given to this Congress that certain Captains in
Col. Luddington’s regiment of militia in Dutchess
County have refused to draft out of their
respective companies for the purpose of brigade
of militia to be raised in this county for the Continental
service as recommended by this Congress
in pursuance of the resolves of the Continental
Congress of the 1st, 3rd and 4th inst. Resolved,
That the general committee of the said county be
requested to make inquiry into the premises, and
upon due proof of the charge against the said
captains, to send them under proper guard to this
Congress to be dealt with according to their deserts.</p>

</div>

<p>During that summer Colonel Ludington seems to
have been much engaged with duties in Westchester
County. Thus in General Putnam’s general orders
we find, under date of White Plains, September 19,
1777, the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Colo. Ludington to furnish guards and patroles
from the camp to the North River. Majr.
Gray to Send a guard and patrole on the road
between Stephen Woods and the North River.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, on September 21, the order ran:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Officer of the Day to-morrow Colo Ludenton
the same No to go on Piquit to-night as Last
night &amp; on the same roads great care to be taken
not to put any on this Piquit but such in whose
Fidelity the greatest Confidence may be Placed.
Colo Ludington &amp; Major Gray will guard the
same Roads as yesterday. Patroleing Partys
are Constantly to be kept up.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, the next day, the order ran: “The guards
and Piquits are to be kept up also Majr. Gray &amp;
Colo Ludington as has been kept before.”</p>

<p>The work of detecting and arresting traitors within
the American lines occupied much of Colonel Ludington’s
attention, and in it he seems to have been
particularly energetic and effective. His wide knowledge
of men and affairs in Westchester and Dutchess
counties caused frequent appeal to be made to
him for information concerning suspicious persons.
Thus Lieutenant-Colonel Dimon in September,
1777, wrote to General Putnam as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Harrison’s Purchase Sept’r 12th 1777.</p>

<p class="noindent">Hon’d Sir,</p>

<p>Enclosed I have sent a Return of the Regt.
Also have sent for your Honor’s Examination,
three Prisoners (viz) John Crabb, an Inhabitant
of Fredericsburg, taken up at White-plains, who
said he was going to Horseneck to buy Salt, but
on being searched, it appeared that 2/6 in paper
&amp; 4/6 or 5/ in hard Mony was all the Mony he
had in Possession, &amp; what renders his Conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
still more suspicious, was that, James Knox, another
of the Prisoners, was in Company with him,
when first discovered by our Men, but made his
Escape from them, &amp; was next Day taken up
near New Rochelle, &amp; who confesses he was going
to the Enemy: s’d Crabb desiring a Man might
be sent to Col. Luddington, to obtain his Character,
to whom he said he was known; I acordingly
desired Col. Luddington (to) send his
Character, which he did, &amp; which I have sent enclosed.
But the third, as I imagine the greatest
Villian of three, named Hachaliah Merrit was
taken in East Chester early in the Morning after
being out all Night with his Great Coat &amp;
Blanket, &amp; armed with a loaded Pistoll, &amp; who
does not pretend to say any thing in his own Justification.
I am with great Esteem, your Honour’s

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">David Dimon</span>, <i>Lt. Col.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Major Genl. Putman.</p>

</div>

<p>Accompanying this was Colonel Ludington’s
reply to the appeal for a “character” for the prisoner
Crabb, which could have given that worthy little
comfort:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dear Sir,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days later Colonel Ludington himself wrote
to Putnam:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Philipse Burgh Sept’r 12th 1777.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>I have sent you one Elijah Taylor; his Crime
is as Follows: he pretends he came from below
our Lines because he was Suspected to be a friend
to us; a few days after he came to me with his
Brother in Law from Milesquare pretending he
had lost a Horse and applied to me for Orders to
take him where he could find him. I gave him
permission to search for his Horse any where he
pleased above our Lines but not to Return home
without calling on me, but Instead of Calling,
Returned home and soon after came up again. I
found by his Conduct that was not his Arrent
(errand) for at the Same time he and the said
Taylor was Laying a Plan to steal our horses.
The way I got Information was that one Dudely
Bailey, a Sutler to our Regiment, was in Conversation
with the said Taylor concerning their
Losing Horses, whereupon the said Taylor told
him they had Lost Horses and knew where to
find them but did not care about them for he
could take them off in the Night; then he ask’d
Bailey where the Horses belonging to the Regiment
were kept, and where our Centenals were
posted, in order that he might Carry his plan in
Execution; and he further told him it would not
be Long before we should be Routed, for a few
men might do it, as we were Obliged to post ourselves

<p>Jacob Read, or Rhead, promptly wrote to Clinton,
protesting that he had always been a true friend of
his country and had repeatedly been employed in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
service, and that therefore he conceived himself to
have been most unjustly treated in being arrested as
a traitor. He begged to be examined immediately
and to be set at liberty on proof of his innocence.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1777 there was a scarcity of provisions
in Westchester and Dutchess counties, and
the Tories sought further to embarrass the American
cause by shipping all provisions they could secure to
the British Army. On this account the following letter
was addressed by Colonel Ludington and others
to the Council of Safety for the State of New York:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Dutchess Co.<br />

<p class="noindent">Gentᵐ:</p>

<p>Nothing but the strongest necessity could induce
us to trouble you with an application of so
extraordinary a nature, but if we are esteemed
worthy of your confidence as friends to our struggling
country our sincerity will atone for what in
common cases might appear indecent. Our invaded
State has not only been an object of the
special designs of our common enemy, but obnoxious
to the wicked, mercenary intrigues of a
number of engrossing Jockies who have drained
this part of the State of the article of bread to such
a degree that we have reason to fear there is not
enough left for the support of the inhabitants. We
have for some months past heard of one Holmes
who has been purchasing wheat and flour in these
parts with which the well affected are universally
ill-provided. This man with us is of doubtful character,
his conversations are of the disaffected sort
entirely. He has now moving from Fishkill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
toward Newark we think not less than one hundred
barrels of flour, for which he says he has your permit,
the which we have not seen. However we
have, at the universal call of the people, concluded
to stop the flour and Holmes himself until this
express may return. We ourselves think from
the conduct of this man that his designs are bad.</p>

<p>The man Holmes mentioned was Colonel John
Holmes, one of the most wary and energetic Tories
in that part of the country. He was famed as a
breeder and racer of horses, and had a stock farm
near Colonel Ludington’s. Indeed, he and Ludington
were neighbors and friends before the outbreak
of the war, but in the animosities engendered by that
conflict they were involved as bitter foes. Holmes
had a commission from the British authorizing him to
enlist men for their service, and for this purpose he
had a recruiting station on Fishkill Plains in an out-of-the-way
place—a field covered with scrub oak.
There he gathered Tories and drilled them for the
British service. He often boasted privately that his
friend Ludington would one day accompany him on
a visit to General Howe at New York—meaning, of
course, as a prisoner. Colonel Ludington, however,
completely turned the tables upon his old neighbor
and would-be captor. Learning from his secret
agents that Holmes was collecting a company of
Tories on the Fishkill Plains, he quietly gathered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
own regiment for what he warned them was to be an
undertaking of much activity and danger. After
several days of preparation, he led his men at night
to the Tory rendezvous. Dividing them into companies,
he caused them completely to encircle the
scrub oak field and close in upon it from all sides. So
quietly and effectively was the work done that
Holmes and every one of his followers were captured,
without the loss of a life or the firing of a
single shot. There were, however, several severe hand-to-hand
struggles, in one of which Colonel Ludington
himself had a brand new suit of clothes almost
entirely torn from his back. Holmes was furious at
being thus trapped, and the more so when he found
that Ludington was his captor. He was compelled
to give up as spoils of war his watch and purse, and a
large sum of British money which had been given to
him for the conduct of his recruiting operations. Colonel
Ludington then marched the whole party off to
Poughkeepsie and deposited them in jail. He appears
to have had no personal grudge against
Holmes, however, and on a subsequent occasion
saved his life at much danger to himself.</p>

<p>The ardent patriots of the border counties were not
content with merely these acts of forcible suppression
of traitorous conduct, but desired to strike still
more strongly and effectively at the foes of their own
neighborhood. An act of the Convention had already
authorized the occupation and leasing at moderate
rentals of all lands owned by those who had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the British service. At first there was little disposition
to enforce the measure, but as the Revolution
proceeded, and the “pernicious activity” of the
Tories became more marked, the people of Dutchess
County moved for the execution of the law. The
following letter was accordingly addressed to Governor
Clinton by the Board of Sequestration of that
county:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To his Excellency George Clinton, Esq.<br />
Governor of the State of New York, General
of the Militia, and Admiral of the Navy of the

<p>The Memorial of Theodorus Van Wyck and
Henry Livingston Jun. Commissioners of Sequestration
for the County of Dutchess.</p>

<p>Sheweth, That, whereas, on the 13th day of
May, 1777, The honorable the Convention of the
Representatives of the State of New York came
to the following resolution “Resolved that the
Commissioners of sequestration be directed &amp; impowered
to lease out the lands &amp; Tenements of all
such persons as already have gone, or hereafter
shall go, unto &amp; Join the Enemies of this State,
under Moderate rent, from year to year, to persons
friendly to the cause of America &amp; who will
Covenant to keep the same in repair &amp; to suffer
no waste to be done thereon”—And again “Resolved,
that in all such leases the Inhabitants of
this State who have been driven from their Habitations
by the Enemy should be preferred by the
Commissioners to others who have not that claim
to the favor of the public.”</p>

<p>Agreeable to the above resolutions your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Memorialists have put numbers of well affected
Refugees Inhabitants of this State into the possession
of lands and tenements deserted by the
former disaffected proprietors. As yet your Memorialists
have stipulated with but very few of
the Refugees aforesaid, what rent they shall pay
for the lands &amp; tenements they Occupy. Your
Memorialists wish to have pointed out to them,
what proportion of the highest rent they could
obtain from others, for lands and tenements
above described, the said Refugees should pay.</p>

<p>Your Memorialists would also beg leave to
represent to your Excellency, that numbers of
persons now with our Enemies own large tracts

have in many instances applyed to your Memorialists
for direction. By virtue of any
Resolutions made by the Legislature your
Memorialists do not think themselves authorized
to receive the Same.</p>

<p>The governor’s reply to this appeal was not altogether
satisfactory to the more ardent patriots, who
were suffering much in their private estates from the
ravages of British irregulars and their Tory allies,
and accordingly a memorial was soon presented to
the Convention asking for further legislation of a
particularly stringent kind. Made by the freeholders
and citizens of Dutchess County, this memorial
was doubtless signed by Colonel Ludington together
with many others, and expressed his vigorous opinions.
It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To the Honorable the Senate and Assembly of
the State of New York,</p>

<p class="noindent">The respectful address and petition of the Freeholders
and Others, Inhabitants of the County of
Dutchess, Friends to the freedom and Independence
of the United States of America,</p>

<p class="noindent">Humbly Sheweth:</p>

<p>That the nefarious and most cruel Designs of
the King and parliament of Great Britain, to reduce
our Country to Vasalage, have been and still
continue to be executed with a degree of Malice
and Rancour, altogether inconsistent with the
character of a Nation professing Christianity, or
even a regard to common Justice and humanity;
that while your petitioners in defence of their
Rights and freedom have opposed the devices inspired
by Tyranny, and have suffered severely,
many of them in their own proper persons, and
effects, and all in those of their friends and fellow
citizens; they have always had, as they hope, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
well grounded confidence in the Wisdom and
Justice of an honest, impartial Legislature, by
whom they trust such an adequate adjustment of
forfeited property will be effected as may duly
punish the authors of the publick Calamities, relieve
the distressed and be the most conducive to
the General good of the State.</p>

<p>That as you are now entering upon the Business
of the second year of the Legislature of this
State, we Doubt not but a Variety of important
matters presents themselves to your consideration,
among which, in our opinion, one of the
greatest is the confiscation and sale of the property
of the Traitorous Enemies of this State; that
our Debts contracted in prosecuting this necessary
War, are become enormous; that the whole
of this Burden will be as intolerable for us and
our children to bear, as it will be cruel to exact it
of us; That the only expedient for our relief will
be the appropriation of the property within this
State, of those unnatural Enemies, (whether now
within or out of it) by whose wicked practices the
War, with all its horrors, Calamities and consequent
charges, was brought upon us and is continued
to this present period in the American
States by them devoted to destruction. To this
end have they not exerted every faculty, cancelled
every social and sacred Obligation, and to the utmost
assisted the Enemies of their Country, irritated
them against it, and urged them to compleat
its distruction? Have not many of them
embodied with the British Troops, assisted in
their councils, aided and abetted them in contriving
and executing all their infernal measures?</p>

<p>Lenity to such atrocious offenders, we conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to be cruelty to the State in General, and to mankind,
unwarrantable either by the Laws of God
or Man.</p>

<p>These are, therefore, with all due deference and
respect, to desire and request you, as the representative
body of this State, forthwith to proceed
upon, and before the close of the present
Session, effectually form and accomplish a Law
for the confiscation and sale of the Real and personal
property of the Enemies of this State, in
such way and manner as may be for the good of
the people at Large, and we Doubt not, in the
Completion of so important an Act, but you will
readily forego every private Conveniency to
yourselves and particular families.</p>

<p>We have with surprise and concern understood
that several members of your honorable
Houses are impatient to close the Session, on account
of their Domestic concerns. We would
humbly beg leave to remind such gentlemen that,
however pressing their private affairs may be, the
publick Demands ought to be first attended to,
as in them the Interest of every Individual is devolved;
and in particular this Act ought by no
means to be postponed. The publick Debts, the
alarming Depreciation of our paper money, are
pressing, and will admit of no delay. The present
and not the future is in your power, and were
it necessary to use arguments on this subject to
patriots, it would be easy to show that the delay
of this Act to another Session is big with uncertainty
of its passing at all, and therefore of the
most dangerous consequences to this State.
Especially as it will occasion universal uneasiness
and in all probability produce Tumults and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
insurrections, and tend to a Domestic Tyranny and
confusion as much to be dreaded as the evils
brought upon us by our connections with Great
Britain, the Effects of which we thus wofully experience.
Tho’ thro’ the smiles of Heaven upon
our past endeavors, we are now arrived within
view of our native inheritance, the promised
Land of peace and freedom, to which we look
with longing Eyes. But our unremited exertions
are still necessary to bring us to the Haven of
rest. Else all our past Labors may still prove in
vain, all our fair prospects be darkened by Intervening
Clouds, that may drive us again upon a
tempestuous sea of trouble till we are overwhelmed
and Lost. To prevent this we and all
your Constituents look up with Anxious Expectations
to you, on whom is devolved the care of
the State Vessel, and on whom we depend to
pilot it into a port of safety; and we trust your
vigilance and unwearied application to the important
Duties of your Station will be continued
till the great End is Obtained, for which as in
Duty bound we shall ever pray, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Poughkeepsie, October 22nd, 1778.</p>

</div>

<p>It was inevitable that his activity and zeal in promoting
and executing such measures should make
Colonel Ludington an object of especial antipathy
to the local Tories and also to the British authorities
in New York. He was regarded by them as one of
the chief obstacles to the raising of troops and the
securing of supplies for the British Army in the
border region. Accordingly the strongest efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
were made to get rid of him, either by death or capture.
On more than one occasion he was shot at by
hidden marksmen by the wayside and narrowly
escaped being killed. The British authorities offered
a reward of three hundred guineas for his person,
and more than one of his disaffected neighbors
sought to win that prize. Much of the time his house
was guarded by a detachment of his regiment, but
often for days and weeks when he was at home his
only sentinels were his two older daughters, Sibyl
and Rebecca. These children would sit for hours,
armed with heavy muskets, at the upper windows,
behind casks on the piazza, or in a neighboring
cornfield, watching for the approach of suspicious
or openly hostile characters and ready to give
their father warning. One night they espied a number
of moving figures, lurking behind trees and
fences, and at once waked their father with the warning
that Tories were surrounding the house. Colonel
Ludington, having no aid at hand sufficient to offer
defense, resorted to a ruse. He hurriedly aroused
the inmates and distributed them through all the
rooms, each with a musket and a lighted candle. The
general illumination of the building, the signs of commotion,
and the shadows of moving and armed figures
on every window blind, persuaded the Tories
that a company of soldiers was in the house. They
therefore feared to make the attack which they had
intended, but contented themselves with yelling and
hooting in the adjoining woods until day began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
break, when they retired down the road to the southward,
through the little settlement which then occupied
the present site of the village of Carmel.</p>

<p>The next day Colonel Ludington ascertained that
his nocturnal visitors were Tories from Quaker Hill
and Pawling, under the leadership of Dr. Prosser,
who has already been mentioned in this narrative,
and were about forty in number. Prosser was a
neighbor of Colonel Ludington’s, but was also his
bitter enemy, and was one of the most virulent Tories
in all that region. He was that night leading his
company down to New York to join the British
Army, and had planned to kill or capture Colonel
Ludington and thus secure the reward of three hundred
guineas which General Howe had offered.
After the war Prosser returned to Dutchess County
to live, thinking his Toryism would be forgotten or
condoned. But Colonel Ludington had not forgotten
nor forgiven his midnight attempt at murder or
capture. One day the two men met on the highway
at Patterson, both being on horseback. As soon as
Prosser caught sight of the man whom he had tried to
“remove,” he turned and attempted to avoid him.
But Colonel Ludington and his horse were too quick
for him. Overtaking him the Colonel belabored him
with a heavy rawhide whip and gave him a most
thorough flogging, which of course Prosser could not
venture to resent by legal means.</p>

<p>On another occasion during the war two gentlemen
and their servants, strangers, stopped at Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Ludington’s house and asked for entertainment for
the night. They were received with some misgivings
as to their loyalty. Some time after they had retired
the watching members of the family perceived that
the house was surrounded by armed men. Suspecting
that the strangers were in league with the besiegers,
they went to their room, roused them, and at
the muzzles of muskets demanded to know who they
were and what was their business. The strangers
managed to assure them that they were friends, and
thereupon joined the family in lighting up the house
and giving it the appearance of a well-garrisoned
stronghold. As on the former occasion the ruse was
effective and the attacking party withdrew.</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington’s activities and also his difficulties
in raising troops for various purposes are suggested
in some of his correspondence with Governor
Clinton:</p>

<p>The British raid up the Hudson, with the burning
of Kingston, already mentioned, provoked much activity
throughout the border region, and resulted in
added suffering to the unfortunate inhabitants. Immediately
after the burning of Kingston the Committee
of Safety, meeting at Marbletown, adopted
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas, The late destruction of the town of
Kingston, and a vast number of dwelling houses,
improvements, grain and fodder on either side of
Hudson’s River, by a cruel, inhuman and merciless
enemy, has deprived many persons and families,
the good subjects of the State, of shelter and
subsistence for themselves and their cattle—calamities
which by the blessing of God on the
fruits of this land those who have not shared in so
uncommon a misfortune are enabled in a great
measure to relieve;</p>

<p>Resolved, Therefore, that it be, and it is hereby
most earnestly recommended to the several and
respective general and district committees of the
counties of Ulster, Dutchess, Orange and Westchester,
to make, or cause to be made, a proper
and proportionate distribution of the aforesaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
distressed persons and families, and their cattle,
to the end that they may all be provided for as the
circumstances of the country will permit; and it
is hereby most strenuously urged on all those who
may not have shared with them in their afflictions
to receive the aforesaid persons, families and cattle,
and furnish them with shelter and subsistence
at a moderate rate.</p>

</div>

<p>To this humane appeal the patriotic part of the
population cordially responded, but of course the
British sympathizers were reluctant to do so. Their
reluctance and refusal brought upon them, however,
the increased wrath of the patriots, and incited to increased
zeal the committees whose province it was to
deal with the disaffected. Among these, Colonel
Ludington was prominent, though he exercised his
powers with a certain humane discretion and was not
inclined to be cruelly vindictive even toward the most
malignant Tories. A letter of his to the Commissioners
of Sequestration, now in the possession of
Mr. William E. Dean, of Fishkill, runs as follows,
its reference being to the “Red Mills,” near Lake
Mahopac:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The sternness of the dealings of the State with

which was made by the State Convention on October
22, 1779, which ran in part:</p>

<p class="caption">A mahogany table belonging to Colonel Ludington, at which,
according to family tradition, Washington
and Rochambeau dined.</p>
<p class="caption">(Now in the possession of Charles Henry Ludington)</p>
</div>

<p>Fredericksburgh and the neighborhood were frequently
traversed by officers and bodies of troops,
especially in making the journey from Hartford and
New Haven to Fishkill. Washington himself often
made that journey, and was a familiar guest at Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Ludington’s house. On one occasion Washington
and Rochambeau, on their way from Hartford
to Fishkill, called there for dinner.</p>

<p>In the journal of Captain William Beatty, of the
Maryland Line, the following entry occurs under
date of Sunday, September 20, 1778:</p>

<p>“We marched about four miles past Fredericksburgh,
where we lay until the 22nd, on which day our
division marched about 12 miles towards Fishkill.
At this place we lay until the 28th, when we marched
to Fishkills.” It seems probable that on this march
the troops, presumably under Baron De Kalb, passed
by Colonel Ludington’s house, and were halted there
for the two days mentioned. If so, their stopping
there and paying in scrip for the food supplied by
the Ludingtons form the basis of the tradition in the
Ludington family, that at one time Colonel Ludington
received so much depreciated currency from the
soldiers that he scarcely knew what to do with it, and
finally stored it under the floor boards of his house
for safe keeping. Mrs. Ludington collected it from
the soldiers in her apron, and got her apron running
over full. Long afterward Colonel Ludington
burned a trunkful of the stuff, as worthless litter.</p>

<p>The Ludington house, standing, as before mentioned,
on the great highway from Hartford to the
Hudson, was often resorted to by travelers as an inn,
and while the British held New York City, the
greater part of all travel between New England and
the other colonies passed that way. William Ellery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of Massachusetts, a signer of the Declaration of Independence,
traveled that road and stopped at Colonel
Ludington’s in the fall of 1777, on his way from
his home at Dighton, Massachusetts, to York, Pennsylvania,
to attend the session of the First Continental
Congress. He was accompanied by the Hon.
Francis Dana and his servant, whom he calls, in his
whimsical diary, respectively Don Quixote and
Sancho Panza, while to himself he gives the title of
Pill Garlick. Under date of “Road to Danbury,
Nov. 5th,” he records:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We intended when we reached Litchfield to
have gone to Peekskill, and there crossed the
North River, but when we got to Danbury we
were dissuaded from it by the Person at whose
house we breakfasted, who told us that there were
Tories and Horse stealers on that road. This account
occasioned us to take the Fishkill road.
Accordingly we set off, baited at the foot of
Quaker Hill, about 7 miles from Danbury, and
reached Colonel Ludington’s 8 miles from the
foregoing stage at night. Here <i>mens meminisse
horret</i>! We were told by our landlady the Col.
was gone to New Windsor, that there was a
guard on the road between Fishkill and Peekskill,
that one of the guard had been killed, about
6 miles off, and that a man not long before had
been shot at on the road to Fishkill not more than
three miles from their house and that a guard had
been placed there for some time past, and had
been dismissed only three days. We were now in
a doleful pickle, not a male in the house but Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Quixote and his man Sancho and poor Pill Garlick,
and no lodging for the first and last but in a
lower room without any shutters to the windows
or locks to the doors. What was to be done?
What could be done? In the first place we fortified
our Stomachs with Beefsteak and Grogg
and then went to work to fortify ourselves against
an attack. The Knight of the woeful countenance
asked whether there were any guns in the
house. Two were produced, one of them in good
order. Nails were fixed over the windows, the
Guns placed in a corner of the room, a pistol under
each of our pillows, and the Hanger against
the bedpost, thus accoutered and prepared at all
points our heroes went to bed. Whether the valiant
Knight slept a wink or not, Pill Garlick cannot
say, for he was so overcome with fatigue, and
his animal spirits were so solaced with the beef
and the grogg, that every trace of fear was utterly
erased from his imagination and he slept soundly
from evening till morning, save that at midnight,
as he fancieth, he was waked by his companion,
with this interesting Question, delivered with a
tremulous voice, “What noise is that?” He listened
and soon discovered that the noise was occasioned
by some rats gnawing the head of a
bread cask. After satisfying the Knight about
the noise, he took his second and finishing nap.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, in Colonel Israel Angell’s diary, cited by
Mr. Patrick, we find:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>29th Nov, 1779. This morning after breakfast
I got my horses Shodd, Crost the North River
over to fishkill. Went on for Danbury, Col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Greene and Mr. Griffen. Greene went for
Springfield so we parted about six miles from
fishkill, but Still could get nothing for our horses,
till riding ten or twelve miles, there Dind and fed
our horses, then went to Colo Luttentons Tavern
among the Mountains 21 miles from fishkills
there put up for the night. One of Col. Livingston’s
Officers came to this Tavern in the Evening
on his way home on a furlough.</p>

<p>Nov. 30th, 1779. Left my lodgings this morning
after breakfast went on for Danbury.</p>

</div>

<p>It is probable, indeed, that for a time Washington
himself made Colonel Ludington’s house his headquarters.
In the late summer and fall of 1778 he
had his army in that region, and made his own headquarters
at Fredericksburgh, as related by Irving
and Lossing. He wrote, under date of Fredericksburgh
on September 12 and 23, describing the disposition
of his army, “the second line, with Lord
Sterling, in the vicinity of Fredericksburgh.” He
was there with the exception of a week from September
12 to the end of November. Part of the time
his headquarters were at the house of John Kane—also
spelled Kain and Keane. This house stood on the
site since occupied by the house of Mr. Charles H.
Roberts, at Pawling, and was a large house, connected
by a stone-walled passageway with another
large stone building, the ground floor of which was
used as a store and the upper story for dwelling purposes.
The land was a part of Beverly Robinson’s
estate. Kane, of whom mention has already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made in Colonel Ludington’s correspondence, was a
Tory and was particularly obnoxious to the patriots.
Under the law of October, 1779, his estate was confiscated,
and he, a dignified and venerable magistrate,
was tied to the tail of a cart and drummed out of
town.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already quoted correspondence between
Governor Clinton and Colonel Ludington, showing
the difficulties which were encountered in raising
troops for various services. As time went on these
difficulties increased rather than diminished, so that
now and then the governor was impatient at the unavoidable
delay. Thus he wrote on one occasion as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Pokeepsie 9th June 1779.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>I wrote to you a few Days ago requesting you
to expedite the raising of the Levies to be furnished
by your Regiment but as I have not since
heard from you I conclude the Letter has miscarried.
I have now therefore to repeat my Orders
that your Quota be raised with all Dispatch
and marched down under the Command of an
active subaltern to join the Detachment from
Major Crane’s and Colo. Drake’s Regimts (stationed
at Crompond, to cover the Country there
from the Depredations of the Enemy) until my
further Orders.</p>

<p>I will send an Officer to relieve, as soon as possible,
the subaltern you shall appoint for this service.</p>

<p>As I think it more than probable that I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
be under a Necessity of employing the Levies
from your Regiment, in the Quarter to which
they are now directed, I expect it will be an Inducement
to the Officers to exert themselves in
raising them and that the Men may more easily be
obtained. I have only to add that I expect also
a speedy and effectual Compliance with these
Orders and that you will make me immediate
Report of what shall be done in consequence of
them.</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington was, however, more successful
in securing recruits than some other militia commanders
in that region. Colonel Roswell Hopkins,
at Amenia, seems to have met with many troubles,
which ultimately led to his resignation of his commission.
In the summer of 1780 much trouble arose
over trafficking in certificates of exemption, and this
correspondence took place:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Amenia, July 12th, 1780.</p>

<p>May it please your Excellency, We, the Subscribers,

Exemption from Militia Drafts Certificates

is whether the Purchaser of such Certificate
is by act of the Legislature, Pass’d the 25th
of March 1778, for Exempting persons from
Drafts are as much exempted from Militia Duty
as the first Procurers would be in case he had not
transfer’d it. There being several such Instances
in the Regiments and different Opinions in the
Matter which is likely to produce uneasiness, and
we being Inform’d that it has been the Practice in
other Regiments to exempt the Purchasers of
such Certificates. There is James Hildreth &amp;

</div>

<p>A little later Colonel Hopkins had a lively experience
with a press-master from Connecticut,
which he reported to the governor—his letter being
of interest for the picture which it gives of the times
and customs in which Colonel Ludington was a participant:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Amenia Aug’t 19th 1780.</p>

<p>May it please your Excellency, I beg leave to
trouble your Excellency with a Remonstrance
Concerning a certain Press-master, one George
Tremble, who is a transient person that lives in
Connecticut, who came to me on the 8th Instant
and told me he wanted my team to carry forrage
to the Fishkills. I told him my Circumstances
was such that I could not let them go, for it
would Ruin me for my wheat, about 130 bushels,
all I had was in the field and it would spoil. My
oats, 200 or 300 busshels all lay in the Swarth,
and would be lost, for I had no help but one Son,
and could not hire any man; my flax a fine Crop
was all in the field and some hay in the meadow,
and my grass lodged and rotting, but he said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cared not for that, but I should go myself with
my team the next day. I told him if I could
secure my grain I would send my son and team
the next week, but he said I should go the next
day. I told him I would not; he showed me a
Coppy of a press warrent from your Excellency
to Colo. Hay with a line from him on the back
authorizing said Tremble to impress teams &amp;
drivers in this state.</p>

<p>I told him that was no legal warrent to him;
he rode off saying he would get a warrent for me,
&amp; then told all about he had got a warrent for
me; but on the 14th he came again with a Sergeant
&amp; 8 men &amp; entered my field, Siezed my son
&amp; confined him under guard, drove out my fatten
oxen that I was fattening for the army, took my
horses &amp; forced my son to drive them with a lode
of my own oats to the Fishkills, altho I consented
if they must go they might carry my oats, he told
me I was a disaffected Person, had done nothing
to support the cause, held bad Princeples, was a
dam’d Lyer and a dam’d Rascal.</p>

<p>I have fined him for cursing; sued him for trespass
&amp; issued a warrant against him in order to
bind him to his good behaviour &amp; recorded a riot
against him.</p>

<p>I think its a pity that there is not a man in this
Precinct County or state that can be trusted with
a press warrant, but such an outlandish Irish,
malicious, abusive fellow must be sent into this
Precinct to press all the whiggs teams, &amp; none in
Charlotte, which is near 3 times as big, and half
tories, for I cant learn of one being pressed there;
after all the malicious fellow wrote a letter to
Colo. Hay sent by the Soldiers that my team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

<p>At the beginning of May, 1781, however, Colonel
Hopkins gave up the struggle to maintain his quota
of men in the field, and insisted upon resigning his
commission:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Amenia, May 1st 1781.</p>

<p>Sir, I wrote to your Excellency about a fortnight
ago to acquaint you that the Classes of my
Regiment were to Deliver their men yesterday,
and requested an officer might be sent to recive
them agreeable to general orders, but no man or
orders came. I was greatly non-plushed &amp; knew
not what to do, but have mustered the men and
ordered them to meet at Peleg Tabors near Mr.
David Johnston, on Saturday this week at 10
O’clock, to march immediately off, when and
where I hope your Excellency will give some one
orders to take care of them. I fear they will not
appear at that time as no one has the care of
them. I fear they will desert, they have got their
bounties.</p>

<p>Sir, I must still insist on resigning my Military
commission as I am wore out with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
trouble &amp; expence of it. I think it unaccountable
that the vacancies in my Regt. are not filled up,
when I have made so many returns and requests,
and have had no adjutant for near 2 years and
orders to send to my Capts. very offen indeed.
Sir, I desire if any officers are appointed this way
to go with these Levies, I might be informed by
the bearer who they be; pray excuse the want of
Paper for I have wrote up 4 quire in a short time
lately in orders &amp;c. all gratis, and know not where
I can get more. I have collected some money
from the delinquent classes for during the war.

<p class="noindent">His Excellency Gover’r Clinton.</p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Ludington also appears to have had many
troubles and vexations at this time, though his “staying
qualities” were superior to those of Colonel Hopkins.
He wrote to the governor on the very day on
which Colonel Hopkins resigned, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Fredericks Burgh, May 1st 1781.</p>

<p>Honoured Sir, I was yesterday a Coming to
wait on your Excellency, but hearing of my little
Son (who is at School at Danbury) lying very
dangerous with the plurisy, was obliged to turn
my Course that way, for which Reason obliges
me to commit my Errand in writing. Your Excellency
no dought has been inform’d of our
troubles of late in Regard of a large party of
Robbers being for four weeks past near me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
mountains, which has occasioned me in some
measure of being behind hand in turning out my
men for the nine months Service, for the chief
part of my Regiment has been out ever since the
Robbers came among us, And, Sir, were you to
be fully acquainted with the Difficulty I now
labour under you would think is impossible for
me to do it, as I have but one field officer, which is
Major Robinson who lives so near the lines that
he has enough to take care of himself, The Circumstances
of my wife and family renders it inconvenient
for me to move immediately if I intend
to save my life, or anything for my family’s support.
My Captains seeing the Distresses that is
daily comeing upon themselves by Reason of
haveing their Sergents sued and torn to pieces
for what Necessity required them to do among
the tories, while we was under the authority of
Committees, and many of their best men are beat
and robbed by persons who say they are Refugees
from below. It is only for them to call a man a
tory, be him ever so good a man, himself, wife
and Children get beat in such a manner that he’s
obliged to turn out his Substance to save their
lives. And at best the Regiment are verry poor
when compared with other Regiments and are
call’d on to raise an eaquil number with the others,
when I can affirm that ten farmers in Coll.
Brinckerhoff’s Regiment is able to purchase the
whole of mine. In this uneaquil way, I have been
obliged to turn out my men untill they are so
much impoverish’d that they almost dispair.</p>

<p>It seems the power of Earth and Hell was let
loose against me and my Regiment. Even one
of the most abandant Ruffins is indulged to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
me up to public view for Cowardice, for challenging
him to fight a Duel. It is what I never
thought on, neither did he think I did, but was let
loose upon me by the Instigation of a set of Ruffins
who Conspired together to take my life, and
I knowing this Kees to be a transient person who
had neither Connection, Credit, Money or
friends, nor no place of Residence here, that it
was out of my power to get Recompence from
such a fellow as he, unless it was by giveing him
a floging, and that he had put out of my power
by Secreting himself. This being my Situation
shall expect from your Excellency some Directions
and advice by a line what will be best for me
to doe. I something expect that General Swartwout
will wait on you this day, who will be able
to state some of the Difficulties I have mentioned
and whether it will not be best to anex my Regiment
to some other Regiment, or give me some
field officers, who in time of turning out my men
will be better able and more willing to assist me.</p>

for more officers as reasonable, and promptly
complied with it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Sir, In Answer to yours of the 1st Instant I
have to inform you that Lieuts. Johnson, Duel &amp;
Becker of your Regt. are appointed Officers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the Levies. These will have orders to receive &amp;
march your Quota to the Place of Rendevouz.
The last I received from you I answered a Day
or two after it came to Hand. My Letter was
forwarded by Judge Paine. If you apply to the
Secry. I imagine you will find that the appointments
for your Regt. agreable to your Return
have long since been perfected. Agreable to a
Notification in the public News Papers the Council
mett at this Place on the 26th Instant. It
would have been proper to have applied to them at
that Time either to have had the vacancies in your
Regt. filled up or to have made your Resignation
as they only have the Power of doing the former
or of accepting of the latter. I am &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sig">(G. C.)</p>

<p>There may be some other gentlemen residing
within your Regt. appointed officers for the
Levies but of this I cant be certain as I am
neither acquainted with its Limits or their Places
of Residence. (To Colonel Ludinton.)</p>

</div>

<p>A fortnight later new orders as to the distribution
of levies were issued. Colonel Ludington was to be
retained on duty in Westchester County, where he
was much needed. But a sharp controversy arose
over his alleged dilatoriness in raising his quota of
men. These letters indicate the general trend of
affairs at that time:</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington appears to have fulfilled his
word and to have completed his quota in a satisfactory
manner, for there is no indication of any
further complaints, and he is known to have continued
in the service in the best of standing. His
next correspondence with Governor Clinton had to
do with the petitions of two deserters for clemency,
and with the case of a woman who had become an
outlaw. Colonel Ludington’s letter and the petition,
and the governor’s reply, were as follows:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER THE WAR</span></h2>

<p>With the return of peace in the triumph of the
cause for which he had battled, Colonel Ludington
by no means lapsed into inactivity or obscurity,
but continued to serve the State in various ways
with the same earnestness which he had shown in war.
For some time he was again a deputy sheriff of
Dutchess County, and in the performance of his duties
on one occasion was severely stabbed by a desperado
named Brown, whom he was arresting. For many
years he was a justice of the peace, his long service
being ample evidence of the confidence which his fellow
citizens reposed in his probity and of the esteem
in which they held his intelligence. He had not a
legal education. Indeed, as has already been observed
and as the composition of his letters clearly
shows, his schooling in even the ordinary branches
was slight. His rulings as justice of the peace were
therefore based more upon common sense and practical,
elementary justice than upon technical familiarity
with statute law or with the prescribed forms of
judicial procedure. His shrewd sense and his just
disposition, however, guided him so well that his administration
of the office was satisfactory to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
who had occasion to use his court, and it was a rare
thing for an appeal to be taken against any of his
decisions, and still more rare for a higher court to reverse
his judgment. After many years of satisfactory
service, one of his friends persuaded him that he
should pay more attention to the technical conventionalities
of judicial procedure, and to that end provided
him with a compendium of legal practice. This
treatise, admirably comprehensive yet concise, covering
a number of foolscap pages of manuscript, is
among Colonel Ludington’s papers now in the possession
of his grandson, Charles H. Ludington. Colonel
Ludington accepted the advice with some misgivings,
but studied the compendium, and when the
next case came before him he conducted court in a
more technically correct way than before. On this
occasion an appeal was made by the defeated party
to a higher court, and that court reversed Colonel
Ludington’s judgment and ordered a new trial.
That was something which had never before happened,
and was naturally a cause of chagrin to him.
He indignantly declared that it was all because of
the new-fangled methods of procedure which his
friend had persuaded him to adopt, and he thereafter
persisted in conducting his court in the old-fashioned
way.</p>

<p>Among the records of the Dutchess County justices’
courts, or courts of special sessions, are many
entries of cases tried before him. In October, 1803,
Henry Ludington, Cyrus Benjamin and Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Hayt occupied the bench when “Ruamy Shaw was
brought before the court charged with feloniously
stealing, taking and carrying away from the house of
Isaac Russell a pair of shoes and a Tea Kettle
Holder, whereupon the said Court after hearing witnesses
for and against the prisoner are of the opinion
that the said Ruamy Shaw is guilty, … that she
therefore pay a fine of five dollars and stand committed
until judgement be complied with.” The fine
was promptly paid, in the form of a due bill by William
Shaw. In July, 1806, before the same justices,
“Else Lake, Spinster, was convicted … for feloniously
stealing taking &amp; carrying away one Plad
Chinz gown out of the dwelling house of Frances
Mead … and that the said court lay a fine of $5,
and that she stand committed until the same is paid.
She refusing to pay the same, Metimas (mittimus)
wrought and delivered to John Griffen const.” That
plaid chintz gown was a source of much trouble, for
on that same day before the same court, “Phebe
Davis, wife of Solomon Davis, was … convicted
for feloniously stealing one Plad Chinz gown to the
value of $3.50 cents, the property of Frances Mead,
and that the said Court lay a fine on the said Phebe
of $6 and that she stand committed until the same is
paid. She refusing to pay the same, Metimas
wrought and delivered to John Griffen const.”</p>

<p>It will be of some quaint, antiquarian interest to
recall the phraseology of the commissions which were
in those days issued to justices of the peace. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

<p>Colonel Ludington also served with some distinction
as a member of Assembly in the State Legislature,
for Dutchess County, some of such service
being during the Revolutionary War. He thus
served in the Third Session, which met at Kingston
from August 18, 1777, to October 25, 1779, at Albany
from January 27 to March 14, 1780, and at
Kingston again from April 22 to July 2, 1780; in the
Fourth Session, which met at Poughkeepsie from
September 7 to October 10, 1780, at Albany from
January 17 to March 31, 1781, and at Poughkeepsie
from June 15 to July 1, 1781; in the Ninth Session,
which met in New York City from January 12 to
May 5, 1786; and in the Tenth Session, which met in
New York City from January 12 to April 21, 1787.
He appears to have been a prominent and influential
member. At the meeting of January, 1786, he was
made a member of the Ways and Means Committee,
and of a special committee to prepare a bill for the
regulation of the militia and the establishment of
magazines. The records of that meeting show that
Colonel Ludington was in constant attendance and
was an active participant in the business of the
House. He is recorded as voting at almost every division,
and generally appears to have been a member
of the majority. On March 1 it was represented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Legislature that a number of prisoners confined
in the jail of New York for debt were reduced to
great extremity for want of wood and firewood, and
were in danger of perishing for want of such necessaries;
wherefore a committee of three, Colonel Ludington
being one, was appointed to inquire into the
matter—one of the first steps toward the abolition of
imprisonment for debt. On March 6, 1787, the Legislature
proceeded to the nomination and appointment
of “delegates to meet with delegates as may be
appointed from other States, for the sole purpose of
revising the Articles of Confederation”—to wit, the
Constitutional Convention of the United States.
Colonel Ludington, who was a staunch Federalist,
voted for the appointment of Alexander Hamilton,
Robert Yates, and John Lansing, Jr.</p>

<p>Soon after there arose a remarkable illustration of
the dilatory disposition of governments of that day
in dealing with some matters of real importance in
which honor and good faith were involved. Away
back in April, 1784, Colonel Ludington had submitted
to the Legislature a petition relative to certain
certificates for depreciation of soldiers’ pay,
which he had lost or which had been stolen from him.
Mr. Pell, of the committee to which the petition was
referred, had reported that the facts were as stated
in the petition, and that the petition for relief ought
to be granted. Leave was granted for the introduction
of a bill to that effect, and the bill was introduced
and passed by the Assembly. Either it was not concurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in by the Senate, however, or for some reason
it was not put into effect. For now, on April 14,
1787, we find Colonel Ludington again presenting
to the Assembly, of which he was a member, a petition
setting forth that certain depreciation certificates,
amounting in all to 407 pounds 4 shillings, had
been stolen from him, and that after passing through
divers hands were paid to the Commissioners of Forfeitures
for the purchase of a forfeited estate, and
were then in the treasury of the State, wherefore he
prayed for a law directing the treasurer to return
them to him. Mr. Hamilton, from the committee to
which the petition was referred, reported that the
facts were found to be as stated, that the petitioner’s
case would be very unfortunate if he were to be finally
deprived of the benefit of the certificates which had
been stolen from him, and that it would be a proper
act of generosity in the State to direct the treasurer
to return them to him. The committee recommended
that a clause to that effect be inserted in some bill
then before the House. The House, however, voted
not to concur in the report of the committee, and it
does not appear that any further step toward doing
him justice was taken at that time. Finally, however,
on March 12, 1792, the Legislature adopted the
following act:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas certain certificates issued by the auditors
appointed to liquidate and to settle the accounts
of the troops of this State in the service of
the United States have been received by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Commissioners of Forfeitures, and are now in the
treasury of this State, which it appears to this
Legislature were lost by Henry Ludenton, and
which certificates at the time they were lost were
not transferable, otherwise than by assignment;
And whereas the said Henry Ludenton has
prayed relief in the premises; Therefore, Be it
enacted by the people of the State of New York,
represented in Senate and Assembly, That whenever
the United States shall direct that the residue
of the twelve hundred thousand dollars may
be subscribed, which by the act of the United
States entitled “An act for making provision
for the debt of the United States,” passed the 4th
day of January, 1790, had not been subscribed
before the last day of September last, then the
Treasurer of this State is hereby authorized and
directed to deliver unto Henry Ludenton the
aforesaid certificates … being the certificates
lost by the said Henry Ludenton.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus nearly eight years after the original appeal
for relief, which was acknowledged to be valid and
worthy, the Legislature voted to grant such relief at
some indefinite time in the future, conditioned upon
the fulfilment of obligations by the federal government,
which had already shown itself dilatory in the
matter!</p>

<p>One of the most important divisions in which Colonel
Ludington voted in the minority was that concerning
the independence of the State of Vermont,
a matter over which there had been danger of a civil
war. Said the “County Journal and Poughkeepsie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Advertiser” for April 4, 1787: “Last Wednesday
morning the important question for declaring the Independence
of Vermont was debated in the House of
the Assembly. It was carried in the affirmative, as
follows:” The poll of the House as given shows 32
votes in the affirmative, and 21 in the negative, Colonel
Ludington’s name being among the latter, although
his friends Hamilton and Lansing voted in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>In the “New York Packet and American Advertiser”
of February 27, 1783, appeared this notice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Notice is hereby given to the Debtors and
Creditors of Stephen Ludinton, deceased, who
was by a jury of inquest said to have been murdered
by John Akins, to meet me at the House of
Alexander Mills in Fredericksburgh on Monday
the 10th day of March next, at 10 o’clock in the
morning, in order to discharge the debts due the
said estate, and receive payment as far as the
estate will go as it is supposed he died insolvent.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Henry Ludington</span> <i>Executor</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>An act of the Legislature on March 9, 1810, made
Colonel Ludington one of the incorporators of “a
body corporate and politic” for the purpose of “making
a good and sufficient turnpike road to begin at
the Highland turnpike road near the house of Joseph
C. Voight in the town of Cortlandt and County of
Westchester, and from thence to or near the house of
James Mandeville and to or near the house of Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Owens, in the town and county aforesaid; from
thence to or near the house of Jonathan Ferris, and
to or near the house of Edward Bugby and Solomon
Avery in Philipstown in the county of Dutchess;
from thence running up Peekskill Hollow, to or near
the house of Rowland Bailey, and to or near the
house of Henry Ludington in the town of Frederick;
from thence running to the great road west of
Quaker Hill, to or near the house of Thomas Howard.”</p>

<p>It should be added, to complete the record, that
Colonel Ludington was in 1771 an overseer of the
poor for South Precinct; in 1772 he was assessor of
Fredericksburgh; and in 1776, 1777, and 1778 he
was supervisor of the town of Fredericksburgh.</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington was commonly known by his
military title to the end of his life. As a matter of
fact, however, he ceased to exercise the functions of
a colonel on September 27, 1786. An act of the Legislature
of New York of April 4, 1782, provided that
“in case of the death, resignation or other inability to
serve, of any Colonel now commanding a regiment
(of militia), no Colonel shall thereafter be appointed
thereto; that such regiment and all others not now
commanded by a Colonel shall henceforth be commanded
by a Lieutenant-Colonel.” This act was doubtless
largely the outcome of the deliberations of the
committee on reorganization of the militia of which
Colonel Ludington was a member. At the date named
in 1786, accordingly, he retired from the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the regiment with which he had so long been identified,
and was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Drake. In this regiment Archibald Ludington and
Henry Ludington, Jr., sons of Colonel Ludington,
were, respectively, paymaster and ensign. Henry
Ludington, Jr., became lieutenant in the regiment
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Elias Van Benschoten,
and on June 7, 1793, when John Drake
moved away from Dutchess County and was succeeded
in command of Ludington’s old regiment by
Lieutenant-Colonel Elijah Townsend, Henry Ludington,
Jr., became a captain and Archibald Ludington
paymaster in it. Henry Ludington, Jr., filled
that place until March 16, 1797, when, owing to his
removal from Dutchess County, he resigned and was
succeeded by Samuel Smith. Archibald Ludington
was succeeded by Stephen Waring on March 23,
1803. The commission of Henry Ludington, Jr., as
lieutenant, is preserved in the possession of Charles
H. Ludington, and reads as follows:</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington, as has already been stated, at
first occupied his estate at Fredericksburgh under a
lease, and did not actually buy the land until July
15, 1812, when Samuel Gouverneur and wife made
to him a deed for 229 acres. Long before the latter
date, however, he had acquired other lands in Dutchess
County, at least as early as 1781, when he was
the owner of a large tract in the eastern part of the
county several miles from his home. It was one of
the perilous duties of his daughters Sibyl and Rebecca
frequently to ride thither on horseback, through
the Great Swamp, to see that all was well on the
property. After the war he disposed of that land, as
the following notice, in the “County Journal and
Dutchess and Ulster Farmer’s Register,” of March
24, 1789, shows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">To Be Sold By The Subscriber:</p>

<p>A Farm of about 104 acres of land in Frederickstown
in the County of Dutchess lying on the east
side of the Great Swamp near the place where
David Akins formerly lived. There are about 30
tons of the best kind of English hay cut yearly on
such place, and considerable more meadow hay
may be made, a sufficient quantity of plough and
timber land, a good bearing orchard of the best
of fruit, a large convenient new dwelling house
and a stream of water running by the door. The
place is well situated for a merchant or tavern
keeper. Whoever should incline to purchase said
place may have possession by the first of May
next; the payments made as easy as possible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
an indisputable title given for the same. For
further particulars inquire of the subscriber or
Mr. Edmund Ogden who keeps a public house on
the Premises.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Henry Ludinton.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">March 9th, 1789.</p>

</div>

<p>The result of this advertisement was the sale of the
farm in question to a man from the former home of
the Ludingtons in Connecticut. This appears from
a document in the possession of Mr. Patrick, the
original of an agreement made on November 5, 1790,
between Colonel Ludington and James Linsley, of
Branford, Connecticut, by which the former covenanted
and agreed with the latter “to sell a certain
farm situate, lying and being in Fredericksburgh
butted and bounded as follows adjoining Croton
River on the west side and on the south by Abijah
Starr &amp; Ebenezer Palmer and on the north by P.
Starr &amp; Samuel Huggins, Containing about one
hundred and five acres.” The price to be paid at
various times and in various sums was “414 pounds,
New York currency.” “And furthermore the said
Ludinton doth further agree with the said Linsley
to Enter on the Farm of him the said Ludinton
where he now Dwells to Cut and Carry away a sufficiency
of timber for the framing of a Barn of the following
Dimentions forty feet in Length and thirty
feet in Breadth and the said Linsley hath further
Liberty to enter upon the home farm of the said Ludinton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and Cutt sufficient quantity of sawmill logs for
to cover said Barn and after the said Linsley has
drawn said logs to the saw mill of the sd Ludinton
he the said Ludinton will saw sd Logs without delay
free from all cost and charges of said Linsley.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington was much interested in the
Presbyterian church at Frederickstown, now Patterson,
and was one of its trustees. On May 22, 1793,
he and his fellow trustees purchased for the church
from Stiles Peet and his wife Lydia a plot of about
a quarter of an acre of land for a burying ground
for the church, the price being at the rate of forty
shillings an acre. He also personally gave most of
the lumber required for building the first academy at
Patterson, an edifice which was in later years destroyed
by fire.</p>

<p class="caption">Colonel Ludington’s tombstone at Patterson (formerly part of
Fredericksburgh), N. Y.</p>
</div>

<p>In person Colonel Ludington was of more than
ordinary stature, and of robust frame and dignified
and commanding presence. He was of an eminently
social disposition, and in the later years of his life he
and John Jay and Colonel Crane were accustomed
often to meet at their neighbor Townsend’s, for social
evenings over their pipes and mugs, to exchange
memories of the stirring days of the Revolution.
Throughout his entire life he commanded in a high
degree the respect and confidence of all who knew
him, and when he died at the goodly age of 78 he was
universally mourned. He died of consumption, after
a prolonged illness, on January 24, 1817. His remains
were buried in the churchyard of the Presbyterian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
church at Patterson, of which he had been a
trustee, and his grave was marked with a simple
stone bearing only this inscription:</p>

<p class="center lh">H. L.<br />
In Memory of<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Ludington</span>.<br />
Jany. 24, 1817.<br />
Aged 78 years.</p>

<p>So simple was the epitaph of one of whom Blake,
the historian of Putnam County, truly says: “Col.
Ludington was one of the most active, energetic and
unflinching patriots found in this part of the country
during the Revolution, and much do we regret our
inability to do justice to the character and sterling
virtues of this Revolutionary patriot. The Government
records, however, show him to have been one of
the bold defenders of our country’s rights.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ludington’s wife, Abigail, survived him
eight years, and then on August 3, 1825, was laid
beside him, at the age of more than 80 years.</p>

<p>The will of Colonel Ludington, now on file in the
surrogate’s office of Putnam County, reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the Name of God, Amen!</p>

<p>I, Henry Ludenton of the Town of Fredericks
County of Putnam and State of New York,
being feeble in body but of perfect mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
memory, thanks be given unto God, calling into
mind the mortality of my body and knowing that
it is appointed for all men once to die, do make
and ordain this my last will and testiment, that is
to say principly and first of all I give and recommend
my Soul unto the hands of Almighty God
That gave it, and my body I recommend to the
earth to be buried in a decent Christian burial at
the discretion of my executors, nothing doubting
that I shall receive the same again at the general
Resurrection by the mighty power of God. And
as touching such worldly property wherewith it
has pleased God to bless me with in this life, I do
give, demise and dispose of in the following manner.
And farm first of all, I do order my executors
to sell and dispose of so much land off the
north end of my farm with the grist mill theron
that will be sufficient to pay the debt that is owing
from me to Samuel Governier’s the landlord, the
line beginning at the east side of my farm on the
line betwixt me and the aforesaid Governier and
running westwardly to the north of my barn and
dwelling house and all other buildings except the
aforesaid mill until it crosses the Mill Brook, and
line then to run more to the south in course (case)
a straight line will not make land enough to discharge
said debt, but to run no further west than
the east fence of the old lot known by the name of
the Old Ridge Lot, and secondly all the remainder
and residue of my said farm dwelling
house and buildings and all and singular the appurtenances
thereunto belonging to remain in the
hands of my executors for the use and benefit of
Abigail Ludenton my wife and Abigail Ludenton
my daughter and Derie Ludenton my son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and Cornelia Ludenton my Grand Daughter so
long as Abigail Ludenton remains my widow or
in case she should not marry, until her decease,
unless the said Abigail Ludenton my daughter
or said Derrick Ludenton my son or Cornelia
Ludenton should marry or either of them should
marry the said farm to remain only for the use
and benefit of those who are unmarried untill my
widdow should marry or untill her disceas as is
above expressed; and in case my daughter Abigail
should not marry before the disceas of my
widow she then at the deceas of my widow to take
her choice of the Rooms in the Dwelling house
wherein I live or when my widdow should marry
which room she is to have and to hold as long as
she remains single. All the remainder of my
farm that is not set off for my executors to sell to
discharge the debt of Samuel Governier, which
land lying and being in the town of Frederick
county aforesaid, I do give and bequeath unto
my four sons Archibald Ludenton, Derrick Ludenton,
Frederick Ludenton, Lewis Ludenton, to
be equally divided amongst them in which case
the said Ludinton and Ludenton is to pass unto
Derrick Ludenton at the division thereof one
hundred dollars wich farm of land they the said
Archibald, Derrick, Frederick and Lewis Ludenton
and their heirs is to have and to hold forever
with all the appertinances thereunto belonging;
but it is my will that Derrick Ludenton my
son’s proportion of the farm to remain in the
hands of my executors and for them to do as they
shall judge best for him with it. And I do will
and bequeath Tartulus Ludenton my son Fifteen
Dollars to be paid out of removable property, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
after said fifteen dollars is paid and all my debts
that my land is not sold to pay is paid and discharged,
to pay which debts is my will that my
executors should sell such and so much of the
movable property they shall judge will least discommode
the heirs which the residue is left to and
share who is to have the property, and it is my
will that all movable property should remain in
the hands of my widdow for her use and the use
of Derrick Ludenton my son, Abigail my daughter,
to remain as the use of the farm is above
discribed to remain in the hands of my executors
for the use and benefit of Abigail Ludenton my
wife and Abigail Ludenton my daughter and
Derrick Ludenton my son and Cornelia Ludenton
my grand daughter untill my wife marries or
untill her disceas, unless Abigail, Derrick or Cornelia
or one of them should marry, and the one
that marries is to have use and benefit no longer
of said property until disposed of as is hereafter
directed. And I do will and bequeath unto my
six daughters at the deceas or marriage of my
widow all my movable property to be equally divided
amongst them, that is to say Sibyl Ogden,
Rebecca Pratt, May Ferris, Anna Colwell, Abigail
Ludenton and Sophiah Caverly my daughters.</p>

<p>And for the further surety of this my last will
and testament I nominate and appoint John Hopkins
of the town of Fishkill, County of Dutchess
and State of New York, and Elijah Wixon

<p>An interesting side-light is cast upon one feature
of this will, as well as upon the later years of Colonel
Ludington’s life and the years following his
death, by a letter written in April, 1881, to Mr. Patrick
by Mrs. Julia L. Comfort, of Catskill, New
York, a daughter of Colonel Ludington’s son, Tertullus
Ludington. Speaking of the old homestead
at Frederickstown, and the members of the family
there, Mrs. Comfort said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I was so young when last there, and consequently
do not remember much about them. It
was the winter before Grandma Luddington
died. She gave my Mother Grandfather’s gun
and sword, and I think the powder horn to my
brother Henry because he was named after him.
They were all mounted with silver. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
time we were there was in the fall when chestnuts
were ripe. There was a very large tree in the rear
of the house, and Uncle Fred’s children, my sister
and myself wished to get the chestnuts but could
not. Grandma wanted Uncle Derrick to cut the
tree down for us, but he said it would take two
weeks to do it, it was so large.</p>

<p>My Father was with us, and Grandfather said
to him, (he always called him Tarty,) “I am
going to make a will, and I owe you for five barrels
of pork, but as I have not got the money just
now I will remember it in my will.” (It was in
war time (War of 1812) and pork was selling
for thirty dollars a barrel.) Father told him he
might give it to Archie, as he was very poor and
Father was doing a good business and did not
need it, but Archie said he never rec’d a cent of it.</p>

<p>The last time Aunt Ogden was here, she was
telling us how she and Aunt Sophia (probably
a slip of the pen for Rebecca) were alone in the
house in war time (Revolutionary War). They
had had a fence built around the house, and they
each had a gun, and once in a while they would
fire one off to make the soldiers think there were
men in the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOME LATER GENERATIONS</span></h2>

<p>It has already been observed that the earlier generations
of the Ludington family, in colonial
days, were prolific; as, indeed, the Ludingtons of the
Old Country are said to have been. In revolutionary
days, Comfort, Elisha, Stephen, and other collateral
relatives of his were the comrades of Henry Ludington
in the war and his neighbors in Dutchess and the
adjoining counties. Their descendants, and the descendants
of those of Colonel Ludington’s twelve
children who married and had issue, have been numerous,
and many of them have made their mark in
contemporary affairs in various parts of the land. It
is not the purpose of this work, nor would its compass
permit it, to give any detailed chronicle of all the
ramifications of the family. Brief notices of a few
of its members follow. Let us first deal with some of
a collateral line.</p>

<p>Colonel Henry Ludington married, as already
noted, his cousin Abigail Ludington. Her brother,
Comfort Ludington, who has been mentioned as a
soldier in the Revolution, had a son named Zalmon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
who in turn had a son also named Zalmon. The last
named was a soldier in the War of 1812; in 1818 he
went to Virginia, and four years later married Lovina
Hagan, of Preston County. Three of his children
are still living, namely: Mrs. M. L. Patrick, of
Louisville, Kentucky; Dr. Horace Ludington, of
Omaha, Nebraska; and General Marshall I. Ludington,
U. S. A. Another, Colonel Elisha H. Ludington,
U. S. A., died in 1891. Zalmon Ludington
himself lived to be more than ninety years of age,
and at the age of eighty-eight was able to make an
important public address in the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>One of the sons of Zalmon Ludington, Elisha H.
Ludington, entered the United States Army as a captain
in 1861, did important field service with the
Army of the Potomac in 1863, being engaged in the
battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, and for
“gallant and meritorious service” in the latter conflict
was brevetted a major on July 2, 1863. On
March 13, 1865, he was brevetted lieutenant-colonel
“for meritorious services during the war,” and also
colonel on the same date “for faithful and meritorious
services in his department.” He served at
Washington and elsewhere as assistant inspector-general
until his retirement for disability on March
27, 1879, and died on January 21, 1891.</p>

<p class="caption">FREDERICK LUDINGTON,<br />
Son of Col. Henry Ludington.</p>
</div>

<p>Marshall I. Ludington was born in Somerset
County, Pennsylvania, on July 4, 1839, and entered
the army as captain of volunteers and acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
quartermaster-general on October 20, 1862. Like his
brother he served in the Chancellorsville and Gettysburg
campaigns, in the Wilderness, and at Petersburg,
and then became chief quartermaster at Washington.
In January, 1867, he became major and
quartermaster in the regular army, and served in
various places and was successively promoted until
in 1898 he was made brigadier-general and quartermaster-general
of the United States Army, with
headquarters at Washington. For several years he
had been acting quartermaster-general, but had not
enjoyed full authority to organize the department
according to his own ideas. Consequently, when he
became quartermaster-general, only four days before
the declaration of war with Spain, he was confronted
with a task of peculiar difficulty, for which he had
not been able to make satisfactory preparations such
as had been made in other branches of the service.
Before he retired from the office, however, he had so
perfected the organization and equipment as to make
the department a model which military experts from
Europe were glad to study. He served until July 4,
1903, when he was retired under the law for age, with
the rank of major-general, U. S. A. Since his retirement
he has lived at Skaneateles, N. Y.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of Frederick Ludington,
son of Colonel Henry Ludington, who with his
brother Lewis engaged for a time in general merchandising
at Frederickstown, or Kent, N. Y. He
married Susannah Griffith, and among their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was a son to whom they gave the name of Harrison,
in honor of the general who was just then winning
distinction in the United States Army and who afterward
became President. Harrison Ludington was
born at Kent, New York, on July 31, 1812, and
served for a time as a clerk in his father’s and uncle’s
store. In 1838 he removed to Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
in company with his uncle, Lewis Ludington,
and there engaged in general merchandising, in partnership
with his uncle Lewis and later with his
younger brother, Nelson. They also had extensive
interests in the lumber trade. Withdrawing from
their firm, he formed a partnership with Messrs. D.
Wells and A. G. Van Schaick, in the same business,
with extensive lumber mills on Green Bay. He was
for many years conspicuously identified with the development
of the city of Milwaukee, and as the proprietor
of a “general store” is said to have purchased
the first bag of wheat ever brought to market at that
place. He served for two terms as an alderman of
Milwaukee, and in 1872-75 was mayor of that city.
His admirable administration of municipal affairs
fixed the attention of the whole State upon him, and
as a result he was elected governor for the two years
1876 and 1877. He filled that office with distinguished
success, but at the end of his single term retired
from public life and resumed his manufacturing
pursuits, in which he continued until his death,
which occurred at Milwaukee on June 17, 1891.</p>

and grandson of Colonel Henry Ludington,

He married Emeline C. Travis. For some years he
occupied and conducted the store which had formerly

National Bank, a place which he filled until his

and untiring labors must be credited the collection
of a large share of the data upon which this
memoir of his ancestor is founded.</p>

<p>Sibyl Ludington, Colonel Ludington’s oldest
daughter, who married Henry Ogden, a lawyer of
Catskill, N. Y., (elsewhere called Edward and Edmund,)
went to live at Unadilla, N. Y., and bore
four sons and two daughters. The distinguished
career of one of these sons may well be told in a
quotation from the “New York Observer” of October
18, 1855, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Major Edmund A. Ogden, of the United
States army, who recently died of cholera at Fort
Riley, Kansas Territory, was born at Catskill,
N. Y., Feb. 20th, 1810. Soon after, he removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to Unadilla, N. Y., where he remained until he
entered the United States Military Academy.
On graduating, he was attached as brevet Second
Lieutenant to the First Regiment of Infantry,
then stationed at Prairie du Chien. He was subsequently
appointed a First Lieutenant in the
Eighth Infantry, where he served until appointed
a Captain in the Quartermaster’s Department, in
which corps he remained until his death. He
served with credit and distinction through the
Black Hawk, Florida and Mexican wars, and
was created a Major by brevet, for meritorious
conduct in the last named of these wars.</p>

<p>His services, ever faithfully performed, have
been arduous and responsible. He has disbursed
for the government millions of the public money;
he has labored hard, and always to the purpose,
and after giving to his country five and twenty
years of hard and useful service, he has died poor.</p>

<p>For the last six years previous to last spring,
Major Ogden was stationed at Fort Leavenworth,
where he has rendered important service
to the army in his capacity of Quartermaster.
From this post he was ordered to California, and
he removed with his family to New York with the
expectation of embarking on the 20th of April
last, when his orders were suddenly suspended,
and he was sent back to assist in outfitting the expedition
against the Sioux Indians. He was
afterwards charged with the arduous duty of
erecting, within three months, barracks, quarters
and stables for a regiment of troops at Fort Riley—a
point about 150 miles west of Leavenworth,
and which he had himself selected as a suitable
place for a government post, when stationed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Fort Leavenworth. This place was not settled,
and was an almost perfect wilderness. He took
with him about five hundred mechanics and laborers,
with tools and provisions, and commenced
his labors. In a new and unsettled country, so
destitute of resources, many obstacles were encountered,
but just as they were being overcome,
and the buildings were progressing, cholera in its
most fatal and frightful form made its appearance
among the men, from two to four of them
dying every day. Far removed from homes and
kindred, and accustomed to depend upon Major
Ogden for the supply of their daily wants, they
turned to him in despair for relief from the pestilence.
He labored among them night and day,
nursing the sick and offering consolation to the
dying. At last the heavy hand of death was laid
upon him, and worn out with care, watching
and untiring labors, he fell a victim to the
disease whose ravages he had in vain attempted
to stay.</p>

<p>In the death of this officer the army has lost one
who was an ornament to its list; his own corps has
lost one of its most efficient members—one whom
they appreciated, and whom they delighted to
praise. Among his associates in the army there is
but one sentiment—that of regret for his loss and
admiration for his professional and private character,
and love for his estimable qualities. His
associates in the army are not the only sufferers;
but many and many in various parts of the
land have lost a warm and true friend, and the
country has lost an honest man and a Christian
soldier.…</p>

<p>In the hour of death, far from all he most loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
on earth, he was cheered by his Christian hope.
His faith was unshaken and enduring, and
proved capable of supporting him in that last sad
hour. Although weak and exhausted, he repeated
the Lord’s Prayer audibly, and said to his friend
the chaplain, who was by his side, “Tell my
dear wife and children to try and meet me in
heaven,” and then sank sweetly and quietly to
rest.</p>

<p>So died the Christian soldier, in the vigor of
manhood, and at the post of duty. Bound as he
was by so many tender ties to this earth, not a
murmur escaped his lips, but he met his summons
with a cheerful resignation to that Providence
whose dealings he had recognized through life,
and in whom he trusted in death.…</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the evidences of the
estimation in which Major Ogden was held at
Fort Riley by the residents and the men in his
employ. The following is an extract from <i>The
Kansas Herald</i> of the 10th:</p>

<p>“The death of Major Ogden left a deep gloom
upon the spirits of all the men, which time does
not obliterate. His tender solicitude for the
spiritual and bodily welfare of those under him;
his unceasing labors with the sick, and his forgetfulness
of self in attendance upon others, until
he was laid low, have endeared his memory to
every one there. And, as a token of affection,
they are now engaged in erecting a fine monument
which shall mark their appreciation of the
departed. The monument, which will be of the
native stone of the locality, is to be placed on one
of the high promontories at Fort Riley, and can
be seen from many a distant point by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
approaching the place. It will bear the following
inscription:</p>

<p class="center lh">“Erected to the memory of<br />
BREVET MAJOR E. A. OGDEN,<br />
the founder of Fort Riley;<br />
a disinterested patriot and a generous friend;<br />

and an exemplary Christian.</p>

<p>Few men were more respected in their lives, or
more lamented in their deaths. As much the victim
of duty as of disease, he calmly closed a life,
in the public service, distinguished for integrity
and faithfulness.</p>

<p class="caption">LEWIS LUDINGTON,<br />
Son of Col. Henry Ludington.</p>
<p class="caption">(From portrait by Frank B. Carpenter.)</p>
</div>

<p>The sixth son and youngest child of Colonel Henry
Ludington was Lewis Ludington, who was born
in Fredericksburgh on June 25, 1786. At the age of
twenty he engaged with his elder brother Frederick
in conducting a general store near their home. A
few years later he married Polly Townsend, the
daughter and oldest child of Samuel Townsend and
his wife Keturah Crosby. The Townsends had come
to Dutchess County many years before from Long
Island, and Polly Townsend’s great-grandfather,
Elihu Townsend, settled on a farm in South East
Precinct, close to the Westchester County line. He
died about 1804, at the age of 102 years, and was able
to walk about the yard six weeks before his death.
For several years after their marriage Lewis and
Polly Townsend Ludington lived in a cottage near
the Ludington homestead at Fredericksburgh, or
Kent, as it was then renamed. Then, in the spring
of 1816, they removed to the village of Carmel, where
soon after Lewis Ludington bought property which
is still owned by members of the family. In the fall
of 1855 he completed and occupied the house which
is still the family homestead. The wood of which this
house was built was cut on lands owned by Mr. Ludington
in Wisconsin, was sawed in his mills at
Oconto in that State, and was shipped from Green
Bay to Buffalo in the lake schooner <i>Lewis Ludington</i>.
This circumstance suggests the fact that Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Ludington was strongly identified with business interests
in Wisconsin. He went West in the fall of
1838, in company with his nephew, Harrison Ludington,
already mentioned, and Harvey Burchard,
of Carmel, N. Y. They visited Milwaukee, which
was then a mere village, and during that winter made
several long trips on horseback through the interior
of Wisconsin, for the purpose of selecting government
lands. They purchased extensive tracts, largely
with a view to the lumber trade, and in 1839 they
formed at Milwaukee the general mercantile firm of
Ludington, Burchard &amp; Co., of which Lewis Ludington
was the eldest and Harrison Ludington the
youngest member. A year or two later Burchard retired
and the firm became Ludington &amp; Co., Harrison’s
younger brother Nelson being taken into it.
Nelson Ludington, by the way, was afterward president
of the Fifth National Bank of Chicago, and for
many years was at the head of large and successful
lumbering and manufacturing interests and was
prominent in commercial life in Chicago. For nearly
twenty years Lewis Ludington was the head of
the firm of Ludington &amp; Co., which was one of the
foremost in Milwaukee, and which conducted what
was for those days a business of great magnitude.
The firm also had lumber mills at Oconto and docks
at Milwaukee. About 1843, Lewis Ludington
bought a tract of land in Columbia County, Wisconsin,
and in July of the following year laid out thereon
the city of Columbus. For many years he personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
directed and encouraged the development of
the new community, which grew to be a city of considerable
population and wealth.</p>

<p>Thus for almost a quarter of a century Mr. Ludington
conducted a number of enterprises in Wisconsin,
enjoying at all times the respect and confidence
of those who knew him and ranking among the best
representative citizens of the two States with which
he was identified. He was a Whig in politics, and exerted
much influence in party councils, especially
opposing the extension of slavery, but would never
accept public office, though frequently urged to do
so. He died on September 3, 1857, at Kenosha, Wisconsin,
and his remains were interred in the family
lot in Raymond Hill Cemetery, at Carmel, N. Y.</p>

<p class="caption">CHARLES HENRY LUDINGTON,<br />
Grandson of Col. Henry Ludington.</p>
</div>

<p>The fifth child of Lewis Ludington is Charles
Henry Ludington, who was born at Carmel, N. Y.,
on February 1, 1825. Among the schools which he
attended in boyhood was one conducted in the former
home of “Peter Parley” at Ridgefield, Conn. In
1842 he became a clerk in a wholesale dry-goods
store in New York, and later was for many years a
member of a leading firm in that same business—the
firm of Lathrop, Ludington &amp; Co., at first on
Cortlandt Street, and afterward on Park Row. A
considerable portion of the business of this firm was
with the southern States, but a few years before the
Civil War its name was published in the notorious
“black-list” of the pro-slavery Secessionists, as an
“Abolitionist” concern, and as a result all trade with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that section of the country was ended. The “black-list”
at first comprised only the names of Bowen,
Holmes &amp; Co., Lathrop, Ludington &amp; Co., and a few
others, but in time was increased until it embraced
about forty of the leading houses in wholesale lines
in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and was
widely published throughout the South, to injure if
possible the business of those who, like Bowen,
Holmes &amp; Co., “sold their goods but not their principles.”
Of course the outbreak of the war ended
what little trade remained for these houses in the
South, but Lathrop, Ludington &amp; Co. more than recouped
elsewhere the losses of their southern trade,
and before the end of the war had become the third
leading firm in that line in New York. Mr. Ludington
was an ardent upholder of the Union. Unable
himself to go to the war as a soldier, he employed and
sent a substitute, and his firm contributed large sums
for the recruiting and equipping of troops in New
York City and in Putnam County. Retiring in
1868, he has since that time been engaged in various
personal enterprises in New York and in the West.</p>

<p>James Ludington, the sixth child of Lewis Ludington,
was born at Carmel, on April 18, 1827, went
to Milwaukee in 1843, worked in the establishment
of Ludington &amp; Co., aided his father in founding the
town of Columbus, and was for a time his father’s
resident agent there. Later, at Milwaukee, he was
treasurer of a railroad company and vice-president
of the Bank of the West at Madison, Wisconsin. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
1859 he acquired extensive saw-mills at the mouth of
the Père Marquette River, in Michigan, and there
founded the city of Ludington. He died on April 1,
1891.</p>

<p>In addition to the impress thus widely made upon
the military, political, business and other history of the
United States by members of the family, the name of
Ludington, in memory of the influence and achievements
of those who have borne it, is honorably inscribed
upon the maps of no fewer than four of the
States. A village of Putnam County, at the site of
the old homestead of colonial and revolutionary times,
bears, as we have seen, the name of Ludingtonville—at
once a tribute to the Ludington family and an unfortunate
example of the unhappy American habit,
now less prevalent than formerly, of adding “ville”
to local names. Far better was the bestowal of the
simple and sufficient name of Ludington upon the
lake port in Michigan, referred to in the preceding
notice of James Ludington’s life. The same name is
borne by a village in the parish of Calcasieu, in southwestern
Louisiana, while the part the Ludington
family played in the settlement and upbuilding of
the State of Wisconsin is commemorated in the name
of a village in Eau Claire County, which retains an
old and familiar variant of spelling, Luddington.</p>

<p>The quoted tribute to the English Ludingtons of
former centuries, with which this volume was begun,
might well, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, be recalled at its close
for application to the Ludingtons of America. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
boast of being of “great estate” is worthily matched
with the record of having contributed something of
substantial value to the common wealth of the Great
Republic, and travels in Eastern lands are rivalled
with travels and labors in the greater regions of the
West; while even wars against the Paynim and loyalty
to the King did not surpass in merit the war for
liberty and independence and loyalty to the intrinsic
rights of man. In this view of the case, it is confidently
hoped that not only for the sake of family
affection, but also for its historical interest, it will be
deemed worth the while to have told thus briefly and
simply the story of Henry Ludington.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
